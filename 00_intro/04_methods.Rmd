# 4. Methods 
## 4.1. Participants
Participants proceeded from five different pools: 30 monolinguals speakers of Spanish (MON, females = 20), 30 L2 Spanish intermediate with L1 English (IEN, females = 14), 30 L2 Spanish advanced with L1 English (AEN, females = 16), 30 L2 Spanish intermediate with L1 Mandarin (IMA, females = 13), and 30 L2 Spanish advanced with L1 Mandarin (AMA, females = 20). All participants grew up in monolingual regions and houses. Participants of the five groups were aged 18-45 (MON: mean = 26.2, _SD_ = 8.82; IEN: mean = 24.9, _SD_ = 3.75; AEN: mean = 26.3, _SD_ = 4.64; IMA: mean = 24.1, _SD_ = 3.97; AMA: mean = 24.8, _SD_ = 4.72). Participants were all right-handed. Additionally, speakers were homogenized for verbal WM. Participants had normal to corrected-to-normal hearing and vision and no motor disability. All data were collected in Spain, to avoid possible biases of context in comparing the L2 speakers [@beatty2019interactional].    
The monolingual speakers were native to a Peninsular variety of Spanish and did not speak any other language fluently. They might have traveled abroad, but not stayed for a long period of time. They all had completed at least high school.     
The Mandarin speakers came from Mandarin-speaking regions in China. In some of these regions, dialects might be spoken, but the differences consist mainly of lexical choices. Some of the Chinese speakers also spoke English, but at a maximum of intermediate proficiency. They had never received bilingual English-Mandarin education, or lived in an English-speaking country. IMA had resided in Spain for 6 months to 11 years, and AMA for 2 months 16 years.      
The English natives came from English-speaking countries. The L2 speakers were matched through DELE (see section 4.3.1.) in terms of proficiency across levels and they were all late learners of Spanish. That is, all L2 participants had started learning Spanish after 12 years of age (IEN: mean = 22.3, _SD_ = 4.32; AEN: mean = 19.9, _SD_ = 2.91; IMA: mean = 21.6, _SD_ = 4.31; AMA: mean = 20.6, _SD_ = 3.40). On average, all L2 groups used Spanish less than 50% of the time on a normal week (self-reported; in percents, IEN: mean = 31.1, _SD_ = 18.7; AEN: mean = 37.2, _SD_ = 14.5; IMA: mean = 47.4, _SD_ = 19.8; AMA: mean = 47.2, _SD_ = 22.6). All L2 participants had also completed studies up to high school at least. Participants were only allowed to take part in the studies if they had lived in Spain or any other speaking country for at least 2 months. None of the L2 participants had lived in non-monolingual communities in Spain, or in non-Spanish speaking countries. The residing time in Spain range for IEN was 3 months to 5 years and a half, and for AEN 7 months to 10 years.    

## 4.2. Visual-world paradigm methodology
Visual-world paradigm is an eye-tracking technique in which a target word or image is projected on a screen accompanied by distractors [@cooper1974control]. Usually, participants hear some audio at the same time related to the target. At the same time participants hear the audio track, their eye-movement patterns between the target and the distractors are recorded. These recordings can be set up to include information such as gaze fixations, saccades, blinks, or pupil dilation.      
There are many other eye-tracking techniques employed for other types of research such as examining reading patterns [e.g. @carpenter1977reading; @child2020tracking]. All eye-tracking techniques are based on the idea that we bring our attention to a specific area in our visual field by fixating our gaze —i.e. pupil— there. It is possible to use these movements to know how and when each piece of information is processed [@duchowski2007eye]. This link between information processing and eye-movements happens because the non-linguistic context mediates language recognition and processing [@tanenhaus1995integration], and this search for connection between language and environment becomes apparent through eye-movements. One of the advantages of eye-tracking is that it is an online method, by which we can see almost real-time how information is processed [@huettig2011using; @altmann2007real; @salverda2014immediate]. This characteristic offers an alternative to offline methods that provide only deliberate responses that show nothing of how information is processed and used to anticipate future information even if speakers are not required to do anything else, like press a button or answer a comprehension question.     
Although visual-world paradigm has some limitations [unnecessary priming, @ito2016prediction; unnatural priming, @huettig2016prediction], its conveniency has made it a fairly popular technique in anticipation studies with different linguistic structures: phonetic [@salverda2014immediate], phonological [@allopenna1998tracking], morphosyntactic [@huettig2016prediction; @lew2010real], syntactic [@pozzan2016semantic; @staub2006syntactic], semantic [@altmann1999incremental; @dijkgraaf2017predicting], and even in structures that reveal world biases [@kamide2003time]. This technique has been used to research both L1 anticipation [e.g., @altmann2007real] and L2 anticipation [e.g., @sagarra2018suprasegmental].     
In the current project, the linguistic anticipation task consisted of a visual-world paradigm in Spanish that measured L1 and L2 speakers of Spanish’s ability to anticipate morphosyntactic information (i.e. verbal tense) based on suprasegmental prosodic cues (i.e. lexical stress) with fine detail regarding time effects. The options among which participants chose were two written verbs. I used words instead of images to avoid possible confusion caused by abstractness in drawings [@huettig2007tug] or the need to anticipate too much visual context information. In order to minimize excessive priming [@huettig2016prediction], the target word and the distractor were previewed only for one second.  

## 4.3. Materials
Participants completed a series of tasks that allowed to filter them in or out of the studies, to measure their linguistic anticipation abilities (visual-world paradigm), their auditory anticipation abilities in melodies, i.e. pitch, and rhythm, their visuospatial anticipation abilities, their visuospatial WM, and verbal WM.

### 4.3.1. Screening tasks
The first screening task was a proficiency test. The proficiency test was a shortened version [@sagarra2010role] of the _Diploma de Español como Lengua Extranjera_ ('Certificate of Spanish as a Foreign Language', by Instituto Cervantes). The test consisted of 56 questions: 16 on grammar, 10 on vocabulary, and 20 on reading comprehension. The L2 participants were split into two groups for data collection according to their scores in the test. Participants whose scores ranged from 25 to 39 were assigned to the intermediate groups, and participants whose scores were located at or above 40 were assigned to the advanced groups. Only participants scoring within those two ranges were accepted for the study.      
Once in the data collection session, participants were interviewed and completed a language background questionnaire, to make sure that they qualified for the study. The background questionnaire contained questions related to their age, handedness, what language they spoke in their household while growing up, how old they were when they started learning Spanish, how long they have lived in Spanish-speaking countries, how much they use each language per week at the time of data collection, other languages they speak fluently, what musical, sport and driving abilities they have. Finally, participants also completed a vocabulary test with some of the words from the linguistic anticipation task. This test had 17 screen with 8 words each, and participants had to select the best equivalent in their L1 for the words provided. One of the options provided was "???", meaning "I do not know the word."       

### 4.3.2.  Linguistic anticipation task (Visual-world paradigm)
An eye-tracking visual-world paradigm task assessed the ability to form stress-suffix predictive associations. The eye movements while hearing the sentences were recorded through an EyeLink 1000 Plus desktop mount eye-tracker from SR Research (sampling rate: 1k Hz; spatial resolution was less than .05o; averaged calibration error: .25-.5o). The monitor used to show the target verbs was a BenQ XL2420TE at a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels. The rest of the tasks were administered in PsychoPy v3.2. In all tasks, the instructions were given both orally and in written. The written instructions were in the participant’s L1.
Participants read two verbs on a computer screen side by side ( _salta_ 's/he jumps,' _saltó_ 's/he jumped') and heard a sentence containing one of the two verbs ( _El ladrón saltó la valla_ 'the thief jumped over the fence'). Their task consisted of selecting the verb they had heard as fast as possible by pressing the right- or left-shift key. When they made their selection, a green rectangle appeared around the selected verb. There were 4 practice sentences, 16 experimental sentences, and 80 fillers. 

_Visual stimuli_
The words that appeared on the screen were presented as images created with PhotoScape X version 3.0.3., set with Helvetica font and the size 300. The size of each image was set at 1920 x 1080 pixels. The background was white and the color of the letters black. The position of the words on each side of the screen was counterbalanced. In the case of the experimental words, this means that half of the present verbs appeared on the right, and the other half on the left. Counterbalancing changed from participant to participant so a given target would not always appear on the same side.     
There were three types of filler words. The first type were nouns for anaphora resolution ( _papel_ 'sheet of paper' vs. _plano_ 'map'). These nouns referred to one of two professions mentioned previously in the sentences that contained them. The nouns were composed of 2, 3 or 4 syllables. The pairs of nouns had always the same length. The second type were adjectives for gender agreement ( _nuevo_ 'new~[MASC]~' vs. _nueva_ 'new~[FEM]~'). These adjectives were always shown in singular and referred to a noun mentioned previously in the sentences that contained them. The two possibilities shown for each trial were the same adjective with the different gender morphology. The noun the adjectives were modifying could be either transparent or opaque in its gender morphology. The noun was combined with definite articles ( _el_ 'the~[masc]~,' _la_ 'the~[fem]~') that gave away the gender needed, or with the possessive article _su_ 'his/her' that hides the gender cue. The adjectives were composed of 2 or 3 syllables. The third type was a variety of nouns and adjectives that completed idiomatic expressions. The category selected was called for according to the specific idiom. Categories were not mixed within trials. The possible words completing the idioms had from 2 to 4 syllables in length. The pairs of words had always the same number of syllables. One of the words is the typical word in the idiom, and the other word rendered the string of words possible and meaningful but non-idiomatic.
The experimental words consisted of 32 pairs of verbs corresponding to the 32 experimental sentences. The experimental verbs were regular, had two syllables, had a CVC initial syllable, all belonged to the -ar conjugation, and were conjugated in the 3rd person present and preterit tense. As a reminder, Spanish regular verbs have 2 cues to tense: initial syllable stress and word ending morphology. Regarding stress, stressed initial syllables indicate that the tense is present ( _salta_ ‘s/he jumps’), and unstressed initial syllables indicate that the tense is past (preterit, _saltó_ ‘s/he jumped’). Regarding morphology, the verb suffix indicates tense, person and aspect. 
  
_Auditory stimuli_
The sentences were recorded three times spoken by a female native speaker of a Peninsular Spanish variety similar to that spoken in the region of data collection. For the recording, sentence order was pseudorandomized three times, so there were three recordings of each sentence. Sentences belonging to different conditions for one item were always read one after the other. The first recording was discarded, and the version included in the task was selected between the remaining two recordings. The recordings were done in a professional sound-attenuated booth with a Shure SM58 microphone and a Marantz Solid State Recorder PMD670 at 16 bits, 44.1 kHz, and an intensity of ~75 dB.     
The oral sentences were between 5 and 13 words long. The sentences were distributed into blocks by means of a Latin square design. There were 8 blocks. Each block contained only one sentence of each type, so each block contained 2 experimental sentences and 6 filler sentences, two of each type. The blocks appeared in a randomized order. Within and across the blocks, the sentences were pseudo-randomized to avoid two experimental sentences of the same condition appearing one after the other.     
There were three types of filler sentences: 32 sentences contained anaphora resolution ( _Mientras el secretario interrumpe al arquitecto, está guardando un papel en el armario_ 'While the clerk interrupts the architect, he is putting a sheet of paper away in the cabinet'), 32 sentences contained gender agreement of adjectives based on determiner and noun ( _Dice que su colegio nuevo cuesta mucho dinero_ 'He says that his new school is very costly'), and 16 contained idiomatic expressions ( _La niña no cambia por nada del mundo su muñeca_ 'The little girl does not change her doll for anything in the world').    
The experimental sentences ( _El ladrón saltó la valla_ 'The thief jumped over the fence') had all identical syntactic structure and length (exactly 5 words). The verb was only preceded by an NP (the subject) to avoid possible biases towards the present or the preterit verb. The object following the verb was also a NP. Half of the experimental sentences contained a present verb and the other half a preterit verb, but a given participant was only exposed to one of the two conditions for a given sentence (e.g., for sentence number 30, a given participant was only exposed to condition 1 and another to condition 2). In total, each participant was exposed to 16 experimental sentences (half with present verbs and half with preterit verbs).
There were four practice sentences, one of each type of sentence included in the task.     
     
### 4.3.3. Non-linguistic anticipation tasks
### 4.3.3.1. Auditory anticipation tasks
_Pitch anticipation task_     
A pitch task measured participants' ability to predict melodic information based on previously occurring associated pitch changes. This task was inspired by the melody discrimination tasks typically used in music research. This task was divided into a familiarization phase and a testing phase. In the famliarization phase participants listened to the melodies with which they were going to work in the task. They heard each melody twice and at the same time saw an arrow indicating in which direction the pitch in the melody changed.
In the experimental phase, participants saw two arrows on the screen side by side, one pointing upwards and the other pointing downwards. At the same time they heard a melody that changed pitch direction after the third tone. Their task consisted of selecting the arrow that matched the pitch change direction as fast as possible by pressing the right- or left-shift key associated with the corresponding arrow. When they made their selection, the arrow selectd turned blue. Two practice melodies were used as practice items, and 6 melodies were played as experimental items. The practice items were repeated twice each, and the experimental melodies were repeated 8 times each. The order of appearance of the melodies was pseudorandomized, so the same melody would not play twice in a row.
After the first two practice melodies feedback was provided for accuracy of response. The second time the practice melodies played no feedback was provided. No feedback was provided either during the experimental phase. 
The melodies were created in pairs, such that each pair started the same, but the fourth note differed. The experimental melodies were played at a tempo of 60 bpm in a scale of A4. The melodies were pairs, such that two melodies started the same and would differ after the third tone. One of the melodies grew higher in pitch, while the other melody grew lower. A higher note than the base always signaled a following still higher note, while a lower note always signaled a following even lower note. The first changing tone in each melody was meant to act as a cue for participants to make their choice on whether the fifth note would be higher or lower. After the variation in pitch, the melody remained at that newly reached level so as not to confuse participants on which change to judge. The experimental melody pairs were therefore 1) G#-G#-G#-B-C-C and G#-G#-G#-F-E, 2) C-C-C-C#-E-E and C-C-C-C#-E-E, and 3) E-E-E-F-F#-F# and E-E-E-D#-D. The practice melody pair was A-A-A-B-C-C and A-A-A-G-F#-F#. The test was built and run on PsychoPy v3.2. The melodies were created with BeepBox 3.0.8 (http://www.beepbox.co) and saved as mp3.

_Rhythmic anticipation task_     
A rhythm tapping task adapted from @pagliarini2016predictive assessed the participants’ abilities to adapt to a rhythm and thus predict when changes were coming. This task was divided into a familiarization phase and a testing phase for each rhythm. The testing phase of each rhythm consisted of 10 trials of the same rhythm, with no pauses in between. Participants heard the rhythms and one of the beats cue them to press a key on the start of the following beat. When they pressed the key, a green dot appeared at the center of the screen. Otherwise, the screen was blank. No other feedback was provided at any time. The familiarization phase had the same length as one trial of the testing phase (~5-6 s). In the familiarization phase participants simply listened to the rhythm. 
There were 2 practice rhythms and 4 experimental rhythms. Each trial in all rhythms consisted of 8 beats. Of these 8 beats, six were context, one was the cue or imperative beat and the remaining one the tap-along beat. These two last beats always appeared together in a random position in the sequence except in the first and last positions. The tones were always pure tones. The base tones had a frequency of 440 Hz, and the imperative beat was added a harmonic to make it distinguishable, so its frequency was 880 Hz. All rhythms were at a reference tempo of 80 bpm.     
The first practice rhythm contained eight homogeneus beats of 250 ms at 650 ms onset-to-onset intervals. The second practice rhythm contained 8 beats of 200 ms each. The onset-to-onset intervals alternated between 400 and 800 ms, resembling the heart beat.
In the experimental phase, the first beat rhythm sequence contained a total of eight beats at 750 ms onset-to-onset intervals. Each beat lasted 200 ms. The second beat rhythm also contained eight beats at 750 ms onset-to-onset intervals. Four of the beats were strong and the other four were weak. They always appeared in the sequence strong-weak-strong-weak. The intensity of the weak tones was half of the intensity of the strong tones, and the strong tones lasted 200 ms and the weak ones 100 ms. The third beat rhythm contained four strong and four weak beats in the order strong-weak-strong-weak. The strong tones lasted for 200 ms and the weak ones for 100 ms. Between a strong and a weak beats the onset-to-onset interval was 990 ms, and between the weak and the strong beats, the onset-to-onset intervals was 510 ms. The last beat rhythm contained equal tones of 200 ms duration, but the onset-to-onset intervals were 750 ms ± a random error of 30% of a duration of 750 ms. This sequence was unpredictable and served as base condition. There were two extra beat rhythms that served as practice sequences. The task was created and administered on PsychoPy v3.2.       

### 4.3.3.2. Visuospatial anticipation task
An adapted version of the ZBA task [ _Zeit- und Bewegungsantizipation_ 'Time and Movement Anticipation,' Schuhfried Wiener Testsystem; @vienna2013time] was used to measure visual-spatial predictive associations. In this task, a car on the screen moved from left to right or right to left at three different speeds: low (3.342 cm/s), medium (5.160 cm/s), and fast (7.087 cm/s). The car then disappeared behind a mountain. The participants had to calculate according to the size of the mountain and the speed of the car when the car should reappear from the other side of the mountaing, marked with a checkered flag. When they thought the car should reappear, participants were to press a key. There were 8 trials for each speed and direction, therefore 48 experimental trials. 
There were four additional trials serving as practice. The speed in those trials was set at either 4 cm/s or 6 cm/s. The car would move in an opposite direction in each of the two trials for each speed. When participants pressed the key signaling the car should reappear, the car appeared on the screen at the spot where it was at that  moment. By showing the position at that time point, participants received feedback on their tally. In the next practice trials and the experimental trials, participants did not see the car's position upon pressing the key.
The trial ended automatically upon the key press and the following trial started. If participants waited for long enough that the car would "leave" the screen, the trial finished automatically and the next trial started.

### 4.3.4. Working memory tasks
#### 4.3.4.1. Operation Span task (verbal WM)
An adapted version of Unsworth et al.’s (2005) Operation Span task (henceforth, OSpan) was used to assess verbal WM span. This task generates independent measures of storage and processing speed. In a single trial, participants heard a word and heard a simple mathematical problem that could be either true or false (e.g., 2 + 2 = 4). At the same time they heard the mathematical problem, they saw the words TRUE and FALSE on the sides of the screen. They had to select as fast as possible the correct word depending on what they heard was true or false by pressing the left- or right-shift key corresponding to the side on which their response was. When they selected the word, it turned blue. This process would repeat a certain number of times until a set was complete. At the end of each set, participants were prompted to write down the individual words they had heard before each problem in the same order they had heard them. The whole task was administered in the participant's L1.     
There were two practice trials of 3 words and simple mathematical problems, and three experimental sets of three, four, five and six words and mathematical problems. The words and mathematical problems that participants heard in the sets appeared in a fixed order across participants. The words TRUE and FALSE that participants needed to select in response to the mathematical problems appeared counterbalanced on each side across participants. No feedback was ever provided.    

### 4.3.4.2. Corsi-blocks tapping task (visuospatial WM)
Finally, an adapted version of [@milner1971interhemispheric]'s Corsi-blocks test served to assess WM applied to the visuospatial domain. In each trial, participants saw a grid 4 x 4 empty squares on a white background. Some of the squares would flash red for 1 s. and then turn white again one by one. Participants then had to recreate the sequence of flashed squares. There were no time constraints.
There were two practice sequences, and 21 sequences split into sets of three. The first set started with sequences of 3 squares. After the third sequence, a new set of three sequences one square longer followed. The longer trials had sequences of 9 squares. The sequences were random. No feedback was ever provided.

# 4.4. Procedure
Data collection took place in a single session of about 1 hour and 30 minutes to two hours depending on the participants. Apart from the participant, only the researcher was present. All interaction happened in Spanish. The room for data collection was isolated from external noise and light. Participants completed the tasks in this order: Spanish proficiency test (only L2 learners; 15-20 minutes), language background questionnaire (10 minutes), eye-tracking task (25 minutes), rhythm task (10 minutes), pitch task (10 minutes), time/movement task (10 minutes), Corsi-blocks task (5 minutes), and OSpan (15 minutes), and a vocabulary test (10 minutes).
First, participants listened to an overview of the tasks and signed the consent form. Participants provided oral responses for the language background questionnaire. They completed the remaining tasks in a computer, using a 24" computer monitor and Sol Republic 1601-32 headphones.  

_Linguistic anticipation task_     
For the visual-world paradigm, participants rested their head on a chin rest, completed an 11-point grid calibration task, and received task instructions both orally and in written. Then they completed the practice trials and were given the opportunity to ask questions. Afterwards, they performed the task. Both the practice and the task trials followed this order. First, participants looked at a fixation sign in the middle of the screen for 250 ms.  This allowed the researcher to recalibrate when necessary manually. Then, two words appeared in the screen side to side. Once the words had been on the screen for 1000 ms, the sentence started playing and continued until reaching the last word. That is, the sentence did not stop when participants selected the word they heard. Participants were instructed to select the word on the screen they heard on the sentence as fast as possible by pressing the right- or left-shift keys. A green rectangle appeared on the screen around the selected word when participants pressed the key to make their choice. Response recording was set up to be registered only when the press happened after the start of the verb in the sentence, previous presses where not recorded so the setting forced participants to press again until they saw the green rectangle appear. No feedback was provided, regardless of whether they selected the correct word or not. See Figure 1 for an example of an experimental trial.

_Rhythm anticipation task_     
The rhythmic anticipation task consisted of a familiarization phase and a testing phase. There were 2 rhythms for practice, and 4 experimental rhythms. For each rhythm, participants listened to 6 seconds of the rhythm to become familiarized with it. In the testing phase, one of the beats in the rhythm was replaced by a beep or imperative tone that cued the participants to press the spacebar on the start of the following beat. That is, the order of the sections in the task was:     

1) Practice:     
    1.a) Familiarization phase 1      
    1.b) Experimental phase 1     
    1.c) Familiarization phase 2      
    1.d) Experimental phase 2     
2) Test:      
    2.a) Familiarization phase 3      
    2.b) Experimental phase 3      
    2.c) Familiarization phase 4      
    2.d) Experimental phase 4     
    2.e) Familiarization phase 5      
    2.f) Experimental phase 5       
    2.g) Familiarization phase 6      
    2.h) Experimental phase 6

There were ten experimental trials for each rhythm in the testing phase, but participants heard no pause between trials. The rhythms sounded as if the trials were all part of the same rhythmic unit. When participants pressed the space bar after the imperative tone, a green dot appeared on the center of the screen. Otherwise, the screen remained blank (see Figure 2 for a trial representation of the rhythm anticipation task).     

```{r, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Sample trial of the rhythm anticipation task"}

```

_Pitch anticipation task_     
The pitch anticipation task also contained a familiarization and a testing phase, but in different order. In the pitch anticipation task, participants were familiarized with all the melodies first. The section order was therefore as follows:

1) Familiarization     
2) Practice     
3) Test     

The melodies were four pairs of short melodies. Each pair started the same, but the fourth note differed. Participants were not told about this pairing explicitly. During this familiarization phase, a number and an arrow appeared on the screen. The number (from 1-8) indicated what melody it was but contained no relevant information for the task. The arrow could point upwards or downwards and accompanied the direction of the pitch change.
During the practice and testing phases, an upwards arrow and a downwards arrow appeared on the screen, each on one side. The side where each arrow appeared was counterbalanced across participants. Participants needed to select the arrow corresponding to the pitch change direction as fast as possible by pressing the keys associated with the arrows. The key associated with the arrow on the left was the left-shift key, and the key associated with the arrow on the right was the right-shift key.
There were four practice trials. In the first two trials, participants received visual feedback on their arrow choice (right vs. wrong), and in the last two practice trials they received no feedback, imitating the format of the experimental trials. The correct sides were counterbalanced across participants. A fixation cross appeared for 250 ms between trials. A representation of a trial can be seen in Figure 3.

```{r, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Sample trial of the tone anticipation task"}
include_graphics("./figs/tone_task.png", dpi = 108)
```
 
_Visuospatial anticipation task_     
In the visuospatial anticipation task, participants saw a car moving from one side to the other on the computer screen. The car disappeared behind a mountain, and participants had to press the spacebar when they anticipated the car would reappear on the other side of the mountain, marked with a checkered flag. There were four practice trials. In the first two practice trials, participants saw the car’s position as feedback upon pressing the spacebar, to learn if they had calculated correctly; in the last two practice trials, they did not receive any feedback, just like in the experimental trials. In the experimental trials, the trial would automatically finish upon the space bar press. There was a fixation cross for 250 ms between trials. Figure 4 shows a trial of the task.

```

_Visuospatial WM task_     
The Corsi-blocks task consisted of recreation of flashing square sequences previously seen. In this task participants completed 2 practice sets, and then the experimental section began. For both phases, a series of squares on the screen would flash red for a second. After the last square in each sequence turned white, participants needed to recreate the sequence they had just seen by clicking with the mouse on the squares that had flashed red in the same order they had flashed. Once they had clicked the same number of squares as in the original sequence, a fixation cross appeared for 500 ms in the center of the screen, and then the next sequence started (see Figure 5 for a sample trial). The sequences started with three squares flashing and ended with nine squares flashing. For each sequence length, there were three trials. 

```{r, include=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "Sample trial of the Corsi-blocks tapping task"}
include_graphics("./figs/corsi.png", dpi = 108)
```

_Verbal WM task_     
The OSpan task was divided into practice and experimental trials. For each trial, participants first heard a word in their L1 and then heard a simple equation, like 2+2=5, also in their L1. During the equation, participants saw the words TRUE or FALSE on each side of the screen, and they had to press the corresponding key (left-shift key for the word on the left, right-shift key for the word on the right) depending on whether the equation was correct or not. After each equation, they saw a fixation point for 500 ms and another pair of word-equation was presented. This process was repeated until the word RECALL or a linguistic equivalent in the L1 of the participant was shown on the screen, at which moment participants had to write on paper the words they had heard in the order they were presented. The task started with three sets of three trials, then three sets of four trials, and so on until the third set of six trials. Figure 6 shows a sample trial.

_Vocabulary test_
Finally, a vocabulary multiple-choice test evaluated participants knowledge of the eye-tracking task words. For each word, they had to select the closer equivalent in their L1 from multiple choices. If they did not know what the word in Spanish meant, they had an option to mark that that was the case. Participants were instructed not to guess the answers if they did not know what a word meant.             

# 4.5. Scoring
_Proficiency test_     
Each question in the proficiency test was worth one point. Each question answered correctly would thus add one point up. Questions answered wrongly did not deduct points. Since there were 56 questions, the maximum possible score was 56, and the minimum was 0. Only participants who got at least 25 points were recruited for the study.    

_Visual world paradigm_     
Participants' key presses were considered accurate if they pressed the key corresponding to the verb in the sentence, and inaccurate if they pressed the other verb. Only the sentences with accurate responses were included in the statistical analyses. In the statistical analyses, proportion and count of fixations on the verbs over time in the sentence were analyzed. There were several moments in the sentence of special interest, namely, target onset, onset of the first vowel, onset of the code in the first syllable, onset of the second syllable, and offset of the verb. The gaze-fixation data was shifted 200 ms to account for the time it takes to plan and launch a saccade [e.g., @fischer1992saccadic; @saslow1967effects], downsampled to 10 ms and 50 ms bins and centered at the onset of the last syllable of target items.    

_Pitch anticipation task_     
Participants' key presses were considered accurate if they pressed the key corresponding to the direction of the pitch change, and inaccurate if they pressed the key for the other arrow. Only the accurate trials were included in the statistical analyses. Given that participants were primed that a higher pitch to the base indicated a still higher following note, and a lower pitch was followed by a yet lower tone, the closer the key presses were to the onset of the cueing tone, the better the anticipation was deemed. That is, the shorter the reaction time in pressing the response key, the better. Times were averages for the trials in each melody.    

_Rhythm anticipation task_     
Following @pagliarini2016predictive, key presses happening 150 ms after the beginning of the tap-along beat were discarded for the statistical analyses as they were considered reaction to the second beat. For valid timings, the closer the key presses were to the start of the second beat, the better the anticipation. Times were averaged for the trials in each condition.   

_Visuospatial anticipation task_     
Key presses were stored taken as referent 0 the ms in which the car was meant to reappear from behind the mountain. Key press timings could thus be negative if they happened before, or positive if they happened afterwards. The closer the key press timing was to 0, the better the visuospatial movement anticipation was deemed to be. Key press timings were averaged for trials in each condition. Trials where the participant took too long to respond and the car should have "left" the screen were discarded.     

_Ospan_     
Several measures were taken in this task: for the mathematical problems, if participants pressed TRUE or FALSE correctly, and how long it took them to respond; for the words, if they had written all words and if they had, if they were in the correct order. Given that speakers of different languages have different average spans, processing speed in the mathematical problems was the measure taken to compare WM across L1 groups.     

_Corsi-blocks tapping task_     
Two measures were taken in this task: if the correct squares had been tapped regardless of the order, and if the correct squares had been tapped in the same order as the original sequence. For the purpose of this project, only the latter score was analyzed. In other words, only those sequences that had been exactly recreated were counted. The total number of correct sequences was added up for each participant, and that was considered their Corsi score.     

# 4.6. Statistical analyses 
Statistical analyses were conduted on R [@team2013r] using the packages _lme4_ [@bates2014fitting] and _multcomp_ [@hothorn2016package].  The empirical logit transformation was applied to binary responses [fixations on target or distractor; @barr2008analyzing]. The bins of 10 ms were run through independent t-tests to find out whether participants were anticipating the correct verbal tense upon hearing the lexical stress or lack thereof. The bins of 50 ms were used to 1) model a GLMM to observe how the different factors considered (L1 transfer, L2 proficiency and WM) mediated the anticipatory ability; and 2) to model a growth curve analysis [GCA, @mirman2016growth] to analyze the evolution of the gaze fixation pattern over time as suprasegmental and segmental information became available. The GCA models with the time course were implemented by using linear, quadratic, and cubic orthogonal polynomials with the independent variables group and lexical stress. The monolinguals served as baseline. Lexical stress had been sum-coded. By-subject and by-item random effects were also tested. Nested model comparisons were implemented to assess main effects and interactions.      
For the linguistic and tone anticipation tasks, only accurate trials were included. For the rhythm anticipation task, deviation time from target beat onset was averaged across conditions and across the test when the key-presses happened within 150 ms after the start of the tap-along beat. For the movement anticipation task, deviation time from the ms when the car should reappear was averaged across conditions and across the test. Reaction time was averaged across conditions and across the test. For the WM tests, number of correct trials out of all trials were the score used as reference. For the OSpan, reaction time in pressing TRUE or FALSE for the mathematical problems was also averaged across trials and used as measure of processing speed.      
The proficiency and the two WM scores where analyzed as:     
1) Proficiency determining groups and WM used as homogeneity measure.      
2) Proficiency and WM scores as continuous scales to observe how changes in these three measures affect language processing and anticipation.
