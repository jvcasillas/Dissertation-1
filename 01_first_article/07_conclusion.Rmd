# 7. Conclusion
This study explored transfer in the creation of anticipatory associations within-words.
Mandarin Chinese and English speakers completed a visual-world paradigm that measured their abilities to predict tense suffixes through lexical stress cues.
Intermediate English speakers and advanced speakers could make predictions, but intermediate Mandarin speakers could not. 
Our findings thus demonstrate that within-word associations can be acquired implicitly, although this acquisition will be biased by cross-linguistic effects from the L1.
A more similar structure will result in positive influence, while a more distant encoding will result in negative transfer.
Cross-linguistic effects in associations are likely to fade as proficiency increases.
