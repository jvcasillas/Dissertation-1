# 3. This study

This finding along with @gosselke2020different suggest that 
The findings from the studies on pitch accent and lexical stress suggest that creating associations that facilitate pre-activation of morphology through phonology depends on several factors.
First, it depends on L2 proficiency.
Second, word and syllable structure is important.
Third, language transfer may have a positive effect on the acquisition of the association and the previous language experience reflects in the neural network.
Those studies, however, have several shortcomings.
First, two of them rely on response time data to reach their conclusions and those two articles are the basis for the rest of the articles.
Second, only one study focuses on transfer.
Said study is @gosselke2020different, but they only provide evidence of positive transfer, do not take into account that languages may be placed in a continuum of how much transfer there can be, and there is no theoretical framework.
Third, while only one study focuses on transfer, at least two other should have as the L1s of the speakers are not homogeneous, and some participants also speak a third and even a fourth language.
Fourth, the study on transfer uses pseudowords as stimuli.
Fifth, the conclusions in the training studies are generalized to "suffixes" even when the trainings and the pre- and post-tests do not necessarily focus on the same type of suffixes (verb tense vs noun number and gender).

The present study fills some of the gaps left by the previous studies on the association between phonology-morphology for prediction.
Specifically, we address the issue of transfer considering phonological overlap as a continuum rather than closed categories.
We test transfer in real words.
Specifically, we test Spanish monolinguals, English-Spanish and Mandarin Chinese-Spanish bilinguals ability to predict present and past suffixes based on lexically stressed and unstressed syllables.
We test the transfer effects at different levels of proficiency, and thus acquisition stages, and control for possible individual differences by keeping verbal working memory homogeneous.
In order to collect online data, we use eye-tracking.


The current study aims to fill the gap left by previous studies on the acquisition of phonology-morphology within word associations.
This gap is characterized by the lack of grounding online data that serves as starting point for later studies, by very few data on verb suffixes, and by a negligence on possible transfer effects in bilingual speakers.
For that purpose, we test prediction performance in bilingual speakers who can transfer different degrees of phonological knowledge from their L1 (English or Mandarin Chinese) to their L2 (Spanish) to anticipate present and past tense suffixes based on lexically stressed or unstressed stem CVC syllables.
Additionally, we test how transfer varies according to proficiency.
In order to make these results comparable to findings in Swedish, the participants lived immersed in the L2.
The specific research question is:

*1. Do Spanish monolinguals, and intermediate and advanced Mandarin and English learners of Spanish use lexical stress to anticipate verbal suffixes in Spanish?*  
We predict that monolingual Spanish speakers will anticipate verb tense when cued by stressed and unstressed syllables [@lozano2019slowly; @sagarra2018suprasegmental]. 
Advanced-Spanish English speakers will generate the predictions at advanced levels of proficiency.
This type of bilinguals predicted when in an L1 context [@lozano2019slowly; @sagarra2018suprasegmental], and adding up the behavioral findings related to the Swedish bilinguals who start anticipating at intermediate levels of proficiency when immersed in the L2 [@schremm2016implicit], we hypothesize that the English-advanced Spanish bilinguals should have no problem in generating predictions.
Following @sagarra2018suprasegmental, we do not expect intermediate English speakers to anticipate, even if they are immersed.
Given there is no previous research for the Mandarin speakers, our following predictions and the prediction for the next question are based mostly on logical thinking.
We predict advanced Mandarin speakers to be able to anticipate due to their linguistic experience with the L2, and because advanced speakers predict in other studies [@lozano2019slowly; @sagarra2018suprasegmental; @schremm2016implicit].
We do not believe intermediate speakers will anticipate.

*2. How does anticipation performance compare across L1s within proficiency level?*  
Comparing intermediate bilingual groups and advanced bilingual groups, we predict English speakers will show earlier tendencies towards anticipation than Mandarin speakers.
We base this prediction in the closer similarity of lexical stress in English and Spanish, and in its more common use in those two languages than in Mandarin Chinese.
