# 3. This study
L2 speakers are able to transfer prosody encoding abilities from their L1 to their L2 [@krishnan2010effects], so they learn to discriminate and process L2 phonological information even when the phenomena is absent in their L1 [e.g., @li2017effects]. Sometimes, they can even use acoustic and prosodic resources in the L2 to anticipate oncoming nouns [@perdomo2019prosodic] and verbal morphosyntax [@lozano2019slowly; @sagarra2018suprasegmental; @schremm2016implicit]. @lozano2019slowly provided evidence that L1 English speakers could use lexical stress as an anticipation cue to verbal tense in L2 Spanish at advanced levels of proficiency. While English and Spanish share the presence of lexical stress, the acoustic correlates are different in each language, so L1 English speakers might presumably have transferred function knowledge. Speakers of languages without lexical stress may learn to perceive it too [@chen2013chinese; @li2017effects], but in their case, it would be knowledge of the acoustic properties of their L1 that may help in the perception of the L2 phonological phenomenon [@li2017effects].              
Taking a step further, the current study aims to address the question of how the type of knowledge transferred affects language predictive processing. Specifically, this study first examines whether the acoustic properties of the L1 help not only in perceiving prosodic elements in a different language with different phonological structures but also in using those elements to anticipate oncoming linguistic information, even when the acoustic properties are used for different purposes in each language (i.e., for tone vs lexical stress). Second, this study also explores how acoustic transfer compares to function transfer, when the L1 shares the function of a suprasegmental structure, but its realization is different.
The populations selected to address these questions were L1 Mandarin and L1 English speakers who speak L2 Spanish at a proficiency level ranging from intermediate to near native. They completed an eye-tracking task that measures their prediction abilities in Spanish when they use lexical stress as a cue to verbal tense suffixes. They were compared to a L1 Spanish control group. The research questions therefore are:      
*Do Spanish monolinguals, and intermediate and advanced Mandarin and English learners of Spanish use lexical stress to anticipate verbal suffixes in Spanish? If so, are prediction abilities mediated by verbal WM?*        
Our predictions are that monolingual Spanish speakers will anticipate verb tense when cued by stressed and unstressed syllables [@lozano2019slowly; @sagarra2018suprasegmental], but WM will not be responsible for individual variability [@otten2009does; @sagarra2018suprasegmental; @tannen2014erps]. L2 speakers will generate the predictions at advanced levels of proficiency [@lozano2019slowly; @sagarra2018suprasegmental]. L1 English speakers may acquire Spanish lexical stress through successful transfer of function knowledge and L1 Mandarin speakers through successful transfer of pitch knowledge [@li2018effect], but none will provide any advantage over the other typo of transfer. Increased verbal WM is expected to affect extrapolation efficiency positively [@huettig2016prediction] at an individual level, and to bring the start of the effects of cross-linguistic association forward in the L2 acquisition process.
