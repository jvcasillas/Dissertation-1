# 3. This study
Within-word morphophonological associations are essential for language comprehension.
These associations are typically learned implicitly, making them more prone to suffering cross-linguistic effects.
Studies on transfer have a large history on cross-linguistic effects within components, but have not explored yet biases in the creation of L2 associations caused by the L1.
However, understanding the acquisition of within-word morphophonological associations is crucial to explain why L2 speakers oftentimes find it difficult to process morphology.
Previous research on the acquisition of within-word morphophonological associations are not comparable because they used different cues (pitch accent vs lexical stress) in different contexts (immersion vs non-immersion, respectively), because some measured brain activity while others performance, and performance was sometimes unconscious (eye movements) and others conscious (reaction times), because speakers self-reported their proficiency, had mixed L1s or also spoke third and even fourth languages, or because the studies mixed nominal and verbal morphology.
Furthermore, only one study has investigated transfer effects on association acquisition [@gosselke2020different]. 
This study only provides evidence of transfer from two extremes (transfer either was not possible at all or the overlap was complete) but does not take into account that languages may be placed in a continuum of how much transfer there can be, and there is no theoretical framework.
Moreover, that study used pseudowords as stimuli.

The present study fills some of the gaps left by the previous studies on the association between phonology-morphology for prediction.
We address the issue of transfer considering phonological overlap as a continuum rather than separate categories.
To that end, we test online prediction performance through eye-tracking in bilingual speakers who can transfer different degrees of phonological knowledge from their L1 (English or Mandarin Chinese) to their L2 (Spanish) to anticipate present and past tense suffixes based on lexically stressed or unstressed stem CVC syllables.
We test transfer effects at different levels of proficiency, and thus acquisition stages, and control for possible individual differences by keeping verbal working memory homogeneous.
In order to make these results comparable to findings with pitch accent, the participants lived immersed in the L2.
The specific research questions are:

*1. Do Spanish monolinguals, and intermediate and advanced Mandarin and English learners of Spanish use lexical stress to anticipate verbal suffixes in Spanish?*  
We predict that monolingual Spanish speakers will anticipate verb tense when cued by stressed and unstressed syllables [@lozano2019slowly; @sagarra2018suprasegmental]. 
Advanced-Spanish English speakers will generate the predictions at advanced levels of proficiency.
This type of bilinguals predicted when in an L1 context [@lozano2019slowly; @sagarra2018suprasegmental], and adding up the behavioral findings related to the Swedish bilinguals who start anticipating at intermediate levels of proficiency when immersed in the L2 [@schremm2016implicit], we hypothesize that the English-advanced Spanish bilinguals should have no problem in generating predictions.
Following @sagarra2018suprasegmental, we do not expect intermediate English speakers to anticipate, even if they are immersed.
Given there is no previous research for the Mandarin speakers, our following predictions and the prediction for the next question are based mostly on logical thinking.
We predict advanced Mandarin speakers to be able to anticipate due to their linguistic experience with the L2, and because advanced speakers predict in other studies [@lozano2019slowly; @sagarra2018suprasegmental; @schremm2016implicit].
We do not believe intermediate speakers will anticipate.

*2. How does anticipation performance compare across L1s within proficiency level?*  
Comparing intermediate bilingual groups and advanced bilingual groups, we predict English speakers will show earlier tendencies towards anticipation than Mandarin speakers.
We base this prediction in the closer similarity of lexical stress in English and Spanish, and in its more common use in those two languages than in Mandarin Chinese.
