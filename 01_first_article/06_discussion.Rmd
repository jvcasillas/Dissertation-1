# 6. Discussion
We investigated the effect of L1 transfer, L2 proficiency and L2 use on Mandarin and English L2 learners of Spanish's ability to use associations of lexical stress with verbal tense morphology for L2 prediction.
Participants completed a visual-world paradigm in Spanish and we compared them to a monolingual Spanish controls.
Results revealed that all speakers were anticipating the verb suffix at the offset of the initial syllable in the verbs.
Increased L2 proficiency and use facilitated prediction, although advanced speakers never reached  monolingual-like anticipation.
There were no significant different between the two L2 groups.
We discuss the findings following the research questions.

*1. **L1 transfer**: Does transfer affect L2 learners’ ability to make stress-suffix tense associations during spoken word processing?* 
We predicted that English speakers would anticipate tense suffix at the offset of the preceding syllable, and that they would do so faster than Mandarin speakers. 
We expected Mandarin speakers to be at chance level.
Our results support our prediction that English speakers would anticipate, as evidenced by the increased fixations on the target at target syllable offset.
The results, however, do not support our prediction regarding Mandarin speakers, as they were also anticipating above chance at target syllable offset.

The finding that English speakers were anticipating matches previous studies showing that advanced English speakers can use morphophonological associations for prediction in L2 Spanish during spoken language processing when the phonological cue is contained in a syllable with consonant-vowel-consonant structure [e.g., @lozano2020slowly; @sagarra2018suprasegmental].
The previous study on processing of morphophonological associations focusing on the role of L2 proficiency tested beginners and advanced L2 speakers [@sagarra2018suprasegmental], the present study adds to that literature by showing that intermediate English speakers can also generate morphophonological predictions, at least when living immersed in the L2.
In addition, this study also provides evidence for the first time that native speakers of Mandarin Chinese dialect also generate morphophonological predictions in L2 Spanish at intermediate and advanced levels of proficiency.
Together with the studies on Swedish morphophonological associations [e.g., _Gosselke-Berthelsen et al., 2018_; @schremm2016implicit], these studies suggest that L2 speakers can learn to use this type of associations to facilitate language processing regardless of their L1.


*2. **L2 proficiency**: Does L2 proficiency affect L2 learners’ ability to make stress-suffix tense associations during spoken word processing?* 
We had predicted that higher proficiency would be correlated with more and faster prediction.
Accordingly, our results suggest that more proficient speakers predicted more than less proficient speakers.
We had also predicted that even highly proficient speakers would not anticipate to the same extent as monolingual speakers.
This prediction was also confirmed.

The results on proficiency can be explained through language exposure.
An increased proficiency indicates that the L2 speaker has had more contact with the L2 and their L2 linguistic knowledge is broader.
This broader experience may be allowing the speakers to improve their efficiency in using morphophonological predictions during l2 processing.

The gap between advanced L2 speakers and the monolingual speakers is in line with previous experiments in morphophonological associations [e.g., @perdomo2019prosodic; @sagarra2018suprasegmental], which has led some authors to conclude that L2 speakers will rarely attain monolingual-like processing efficiency [@perdomo2019prosodic].
The present study, however, does not lend itself to support or counterevidence such conclusion.
While the present study included some near native advanced speakers as indicated by the proficiency measure, they are likely to few to draw conclusions as to whether monolingual-like efficiency is possible.
Future studies may want to recruit more participants at that level of proficiency to test whether attainment of monolingual-like efficiency is possible or not.

*3. **Language use**: Does language use affect L2 learners’ ability to make stress-suffix tense association during spoken word processing?* 
We predicted that a greater use of Spanish would be associated with more and more accurate prediction.
This prediction is borne out by our results.

The present study is the first study exploring how L2 use affects processing of morphophonological associations.
Just as increased L2 use helps in morphophonological association, L2 use is likely to be a reliable predictor of successful processing in other areas such as morphosyntax.
As relates to morpophonological associations, future studies could expand the findings here by focusing on training.
Previous studies on training of Swedish morphophonological associations in Swedish suggest that targeted training can help in acquisition of these associations [ _@schremm2017_].
Training does not only direct L2 learners attention towards the association, but increases its use.
Training is therefore likely to help L2 learners acquire morphophonological associations in Spanish as well as in Swedish.
In addition, training different L1s can also expand findings on the role of L1 transfer and its interaction with L2 use.




For the advanced groups, preterit tense is easier to anticipate than present tense.
A possible explanation is that they are initially unsure as to what the meaning of stress really is in the present tense, whether it carries only lexical information or has other intonational and pragmatic meaning.
In the preterit tense, however, there is no room for different alternatives as there is no stress, leading into an earlier use of the lexically unstressed syllable to anticipate word ending.
The data also suggest that English speakers improve at anticipating the preterit tense over proficiency but remain approximately the same in the present tense. 
The initial advantage in the present tense might be caused by a more typical use of present tense, providing them with more frequent examples to create associations for this tense. 

Lastly, this is the first study to show that advanced Mandarin speakers can generate predictions in an L2 based on morphophonological associations.
It should be noted, nonetheless, that they need longer to create the associations in comparison to native speakers of other languages, probably due to cross-linguistic effects.

*2. How does anticipation performance compare across L1s within proficiency level?* 
We had hypothesized that English speakers would develop anticipatory associations earlier than Mandarin speakers because of the closer proximity between English and Spanish than Mandarin and Spanish.
The results confirm our prediction.
Intermediate Mandarin speakers did not use lexical stress as a cue to morphology, especially in the present tense.
In contrast, intermediate English speakers did generate anticipations.
At advanced proficiency, Mandarin speakers do provide evidence of such ability.
The ability may be due to an increased exposure to the L2.
Having reached a threshold of exposure may in fact have allowed them to overcome the anticipatory struggle they reflect at intermediate stages and to perform equally well as English learners. 

The different levels of struggle revealed at intermediate stages may be explained through cross-linguistic effects.
The earlier creation of anticipatory association in English speakers may be buttressed by their knowledge of lexical contrastive function in English. 
These speakers may be using their knowledge of lexical stress in English to contrast present and preterit tense in Spanish as well.
In their case, transfer would be positive.
Transfer can also explain why they anticipate similarly both tenses.
The successful application of lexical stress knowledge along with the need to use any resource to process a language in which they are not proficient may be making the English intermediate speakers hyper-aware of phonological processes. 
This hyper-awareness would be the cause of the similar anticipation abilities in both conditions. 

Intermediate Mandarin speakers could not generate predictions reliable or successfully.
In their case, knowledge of lexical stress in the L1, if they have it [@selkirk1990prosodic], may be confused with tone representation, making it impossible for them to transfer lexical stress knowledge successfully.
They would be suffering negative L1 transfer.
In order to overcome the effects of negative transfer, Mandarin speakers would therefore need longer exposure to the L2 to offset the initial blocking imposed by the transfer and create anticipatory associations.
The similar performance of advanced Mandarin and English speakers suggests that there is an exposure or a developmental threshold such that, once it has been crossed, cross-linguistic effects diminish and speakers process linguistic information equally regardless of their L1.

The fact that both advanced groups perform similarly suggests that mappings are stable in the lexicon to the same degree and with similar properties in both L2 advanced populations.
Even if transfer is less obvious in advanced speakers, it can also explain why they do not reach monolingual-like performance.
The transfer they suffered at lower levels of proficiency may remain in the associations that allow them to predict as “noise.”
Future studies may examine whether explicit instruction, or at least focused instruction [@hed2019neural; @schremm2017influence], may help in getting rid of the noise or preventing its inclusion in the first place.
