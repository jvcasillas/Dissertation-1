One way humans learn is through association.
Associations are probabilistic connections between a cue and an outcome [@clark2013whatever].
Associations are essential for any kind of learning, including language.
In language, associations allow speakers to anticipate incoming information based on the cues present, reducing the cognitive processing load and facilitating comprehension.
For instance, phonological cues such as lexical stress can be associated with morphological outcomes such as verb tense suffixes.
Inability to create this type of morphophonological association may be a source of L2 processing difficulty, as the outcome goes unnoticed since the L2 speaker cannot pay attention to all the incoming information.

While L2 speakers eventually acquire morphophonological associations [e.g., @sagarra2018suprasegmental; @schremm2016implicit], the factors contributing to their acquisition are unknown.
Here we investigate L1 transfer, L2 proficiency and language use effects and their interactions on the acquisition of L2 morphophonological associations.
For that purpose, we examine verb tense suffix anticipation based on its association with lexical stress in adult English and Mandarin Chinese learners of Spanish at different stages of L2 development. 
We also compare their performance with a Spanish control group.
The findings from this study can thus inform models of L2 acquisition about the different effects of L1 transfer, L2 proficiency and language use in the acquisition of morphophonological associations. Additionally, it can also provide insight into the learning mechanisms underlying L2 acquisition.
