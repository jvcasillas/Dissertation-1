# 1. Introduction
One way humans learn is through association.
This type of learning is essential in language and second language (L2) acquisition.
The activation of associations allows speakers to anticipate incoming information, reducing the cognitive processing load and facilitating comprehension.
Decades of transfer research have informed how cross-linguistic effects impact L2 representations, but the impact on the creation of L2 associations is an emerging field.
Understanding the effects of transfer on anticipatory associations, especially on those implicitly learned such as morphophonological associations, is crucial because it can explain the difficulty that L2 speakers have to process the linguistic phenomena involved, as happens with morphology.

Here we investigate cross-linguistic effects on the creation of L2 morphophonological associations.
For that purpose, we examine verb tense suffix anticipation based off lexical stress in adult Spanish monolinguals and English and Mandarin Chinese intermediate and advanced learners of Spanish. 
Mandarin, English and Spanish have all lexical stress.
However, lexical stress in English is more similar to lexical stress in Spanish than lexical stress in Chinese.
Choosing these three languges allows to observe transfer effects from different distances in a continuum.
Besides, English and Chinese are both morphologically poor in terms of verb morphology.
Different levels of proficiency were included because language experience is essential in shaping the linguistic system [@bybee2006usage] and so it can shift what a speaker can pay attention to and inhibit in the input.
