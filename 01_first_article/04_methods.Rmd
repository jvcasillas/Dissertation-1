## 4.1. Participants
30 monolingual speakers of Spanish (20 females), 42 L2 Spanish L1 English speakers (30 females), and 43 L2 Spanish L1 Mandarin speakers (33 females) participated in the study. All participants were living in Madrid, Spain at the time of data collection. English L1 speakers had been in a Spanish-speaking country for a mean of 31.5 months ( _SD_ = 28.6) and the L1 Mandarin speakers for a mean of 43.9 months ( _SD_ = 43.6). All speakers were raised in monolingual families in monolingual communities of their L1. The monolingual Spanish speakers were local to the Madrid area and spoke no other language fluently nor had lived abroad. The participants belonging to all L2 groups started learning Spanish after age 12. At the time of data collection, the L1 Mandarin speakers used Spanish a mean of 47.3% of the week ( _SD_ = 21.2) and the L1 English speakers a mean of 34.4% ( _SD_ = 16.6). The age range for all groups was 18-45 (Spanish: mean = 26.2, _SD_  = 8.82, English: mean = 25.7, _SD_  = 4.27; Mandarin: mean = 24.5, _SD_  = 4.39). All participants had normal to corrected-to-normal hearing and vision, and no motor disability.    

## 4.2. Materials
### 4.2.1. Screening tasks
A proficiency test was administered to the L2 participants to screen them and to assign them a level of proficiency. The proficiency test was a shortened version [@sagarra2010role] of the _Diploma de Español como Lengua Extranjera_ ('Certificate of Spanish as a Foreign Language', by Instituto Cervantes). The test consisted of 56 questions: 16 on grammar, 10 on vocabulary, and 20 on reading comprehension. Each question was worth one point. Participants who scored below 25 were disqualified for the study.        
Participants were interviewed and completed a language background questionnaire, to make sure that they qualified for the study. The background questionnaire contained questions related to their age, handedness, what language they spoke in their household while growing up, how old they were when they started learning Spanish, how long they had lived in Spanish-speaking countries, how much they used each language per week at the time of data collection, and other languages that they spoke fluently.            
Participants also completed a vocabulary test with some of the words from the linguistic anticipation task. This test was a multiple-choice test with 17 screens with 8 words each. For each word in Spanish, they had to choose between 8 possible meanings in the participants' L1. An extra option was provided to mark in case they did not know the meaning of the word in Spanish.     

### 4.2.2. Linguistic materials
A visual-world paradigm was used to asses participants' abilities to associate verbal suffixes with stressed or unstressed syllables. The eye-movements during the task were recorded through an EyeLink 1000 Plus desktop mount eye-tracker from SR Research (sampling rate: 1k Hz; spatial resolution was less than .05o; averaged calibration error: .25-.5o). Participants read two verbs on a computer screen side by side ( _salta_ 's/he jumps,' _saltó_ 's/he jumped') and heard a sentence containing one of the two verbs ( _El ladrón saltó la valla_ 'the thief jumped over the fence'). Their task consisted of selecting the verb they had heard as fast as possible by pressing the right- or left-shift key. When they made their selection, a green rectangle appeared around the selected verb. There were 4 practice sentences, 16 experimental sentences, and 80 fillers.
The verbs were the present tense and preterit tense 3rd person singular forms of regular -ar verbs. Spanish regular verbs have 2 cues to tense: initial syllable stress and word ending morphology. Stressed initial syllables indicate that the tense is present ( _salta_ ‘s/he jumps’), and unstressed initial syllables indicate that the tense is past (preterit, _saltó_ ‘s/he jumped’). Regarding morphology, the verb suffix indicates tense, person and aspect. In total there were 16 verbs, so 16 pairs of present and preterit verbs, 16 in each condition, 32 final forms. All verbs had two syllables in both conditions: the first syllable had a CVC structure and the second syllable a CV structure. Participants never heard the two conditions for a single verb. The number of verbs in tense on each side of the screen was counterbalanced across trials and across participants.  
The aural sentences were 5 words long with a neutral structure NP~SUBJ~-V-NP~OBJ~. The sentences for each condition within a pair were the same. The sentences were distributed into blocks by means of a Latin square design. There were 8 blocks. Each block contained 2 experimental sentences, one of each type, and 6 filler sentences. The blocks appeared in a randomized order. Within and across the blocks, the sentences were pseudo-randomized to avoid two experimental sentences of the same condition appearing one after the other.     

### 4.2.3. Verbal WM materials
An aural version of @unsworth2005automated's Operation Span task (OSpan) was used to measure verbal WM capacities. This task generates measures of storage and processing speed. In a single trial, participants heard first a word and then a simple mathematical problem that could be either true (2 + 2 = 4) or false (2 + 2 = 5). Along the mathematical problem, they saw the words TRUE and FALSE on the screen. They had to select as fast as possible the correct word depending on whether what they heard was true or false by pressing the left- or right-shift key corresponding to the side on which their response was. This sequence of word-mathematical problem would repeat a certain number of times until a set was complete. At the end of each set, participants were prompted to write down the individual words they had heard before each problem in the same order they had heard them.      
There were two practice trials of 3 words and simple mathematical problems, and three experimental sets of three, four, five and six words and mathematical problems. The words and mathematical problems that participants heard in the sets appeared in a fixed order across participants. The words TRUE and FALSE that participants needed to select in response to the mathematical problems appeared counterbalanced on each side across participants. No feedback was provided. The whole task was administered in the participant's L1.     

## 4.3. Procedure
Data collection was conducted in a single session with each participant individually. Each session lasted around 1 hour and 15 minutes and participants could take breaks between tasks anytime they wanted. Only the researcher accompanied the participant during this time and all interactions happened in Spanish. The room was isolated from external noise and light. Participants completed the tasks in this order: Spanish proficiency test (only L2 learners; 15-20 minutes), language background questionnaire (10 minutes), eye-tracking task (25 minutes), OSpan (15 minutes), and a vocabulary test (10 minutes).
First, participants listened to an overview of the tasks and signed the consent form. Participants provided oral responses for the language background questionnaire. They completed the remaining tasks on a computer.     
_Visual-world paradigm._ For the visual-world paradigm, participants rested their head on a chin rest, completed an 11-point grid calibration task, and received task instructions both orally and in writing. Then, they completed the practice trials and were given the opportunity to ask questions. Afterwards, they performed the task. Both the practice and the task trials followed this order. First, participants looked at a fixation sign in the middle of the screen for 250 ms. This fixation sign allowed the researcher to recalibrate manually when necessary. Then, two words appeared in the screen side to side. Once the words had been on the screen for 1000 ms., the sentence started playing and continued until reaching the last word. That is, the sentence did not stop when participants selected the word they heard. Participants were instructed to select the word on the screen they heard on the sentence as fast as possible by pressing the right- or left-shift keys. A green rectangle appeared on the screen around the selected word when participants pressed the key to make their choice. Response recording was set up to be registered only when the press happened after the start of the verb in the sentence. Previous presses where not recorded so the setting forced participants to press again until they saw the green rectangle appear. No feedback was provided. See Figure 1 for an example of an experimental trial.

_OSpan_ The OSpan task was divided into practice and experimental trials. For each trial, participants first heard a word and then heard a simple mathematical problem, all in their L1. During the equation, participants saw the words TRUE or FALSE on each side of the screen, and they had to press the corresponding key (left-shift key for the word on the left, right-shift key for the word on the right) depending on whether the problem was correct or not. After each problem, they saw a fixation point for 500 ms. and another word-equation pair was presented. This process was repeated until the word RECALL or a linguistic equivalent in the L1 of the participant was shown on the screen, at which moment participants had to write on a piece of paper the words they had heard for that set in the order they were presented. The task started with three sets of three trials, then three sets of four trials, and so on until the third set of six trials. Figure 6 shows a sample trial.

## 4.3. Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were conducted on R [@R-base] using the packages lme4 [@bates2014fitting] and multcomp [@hothorn2016package]. The gaze-fixation data was shifted 200 ms. to account for the time it takes to plan and launch a saccade [e.g., @fischer1992saccadic; @saslow1967effects], downsampled to 10 ms. and 50 ms. bins and centered at the onset of the last syllable of target items. The empirical logit transformation was applied to binary responses [fixations on target or distractor; @barr2008analyzing]. The 10 ms. bins were run through independent t-tests to find out whether participants were anticipating the correct verbal tense upon hearing a stressed or unstressed initial syllable. The 50 ms. bins were used to model a growth curve analysis [@mirman2016growth] to observe how the pattern of gaze fixations changed as suprasegmental and segmental information became available. The models with the time course were implemented by using linear, quadratic, and cubic orthogonal polynomials with the independent variables group and lexical stress. The monolinguals served as baseline. Lexical stress had been sum-coded. By-subject and by-item random effects were also tested. Nested model comparisons were implemented to assess main effects and interactions. 
For the OSpan, reaction times to the mathematical problems were averaged and used as score, since different languages have differnt memory score and therefore are not comparable.
The proficiency was analyzed as a continuous scale. OSpan scores were analyzed as homogeneity measure and as a continuous scales to observe how verbal WM capacity affects language processing and anticipation.
