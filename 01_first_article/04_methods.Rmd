# 4. Methods
## 4.1. Participants
The sample pool consisted of 30 Spanish monolinguals (20 females), 65 English learners of Spanish (48 females), and 64 Mandarin learners of Spanish (52 females). 
The age range for all groups was 18-45 (Spanish: *M* = 26.2, *SD*  = 8.82, English: *M* = 26.8, *SD*  = 4.54; Mandarin: *M* = 24.7, *SD*  = 4.13).
All participants were raised in monolingual families in monolingual communities of their L1, but were living in Spain at the time of data collection. 
All participants had completed at least high school.
Their cognitive capacity was compared as measured by verbal working memory.
The monolingual group obtained a mean working  memory score of 6.20 (*SD* = 2.72), the English group got a mean score of 8.89 (*SD* = 2.11), and the Mandarin group of 7.78 (*SD* = 2.14).
All participants were right-handed, had normal to corrected-to-normal hearing and vision, and no motor disability.  

The monolingual Spanish speakers were local to the Madrid area.
They had studied English in school but did not speak it fluently or had lived abroad.
They did not speak any other language.

English L1 speakers had been in a Spanish-speaking country for a mean of 38.1 months (*SD* = 33.5) and the L1 Mandarin speakers for a mean of 40.8 months (*SD* = 45.5). 
All L2 speakers were late learners of Spanish. 
At the time of data collection, the L1 English speakers a mean of 33.3% (*SD* = 17.4) and the L1 Mandarin speakers used Spanish a mean of 41.6% of the week (*SD* = 21.7). 
The values used to calculate language use were self-reported. 
Most English speakers were working as English instructors.
Most Mandarin speakers were enrolled in the university.
Some English speakers had studied other languages, but none said to speak them fluently.
Mandarin speakers had also taken English classes while growing up.
Their self-reported proficiency in English varied from participant to participant.

## 4.2. Procedure
Data collection was conducted in a single session with each participant individually. Each session lasted around 1 hour and 15 minutes and participants could take breaks between tasks anytime they wanted. All interactions happened in Spanish. The room was isolated from external noise and light. Participants first participants listened to an overview of the tasks and signed the consent form. They then completed the following tasks: Spanish proficiency test (only L2 learners; 15-20 minutes), language background questionnaire (10 minutes), eye-tracking task (25 minutes), and working memory (15 minutes).

For the experimental task, a visual-world paradigm, participants rested their head on a chin rest, completed an 11-point grid calibration task, and received task instructions both orally and in writing. Then, they completed the practice trials and were given the opportunity to ask questions. 
Afterwards, they performed the task. For each trial, participants saw three screens: one for drift correction for 250 ms before the stimuli were presented, a second one with the target and distractor words alone for 1000 ms, and a third one with those same words at the same time the sentence played.
The sentence was played entirely and did not stop when participants selected the word they heard. 
When they pressed the key to record their choice, a green rectangle appeared around the selected verb.
Response recording was set up to be registered only when the press happened after the start of the verb in the sentence. 
No feedback was provided.

## 4.3. Materials
### 4.3.1. Screening tasks
_Spanish proficiency test_ (only L2 learners).
The L2 learners completed an adapted version of the _Diploma de Español como Lengua Extranjera_ [Certificate of Spanish as a Foreign Language'; @sagarra2010role] to assess their Spanish proficiency.
The test comprised 56 questions on grammar and vocabulary. 
Each question was worth one point. 
Participants who scored below 25 were disqualified for the study.
This test was computerized using Qualtrics.

*Language background questionnaire.* 
This questionnaire contained questions related to their age, handedness, languages spoken in their household while growing up, age of onset of the L2, time spent in Spanish-speaking countries, weekly percentage of use for each language at the time of data collection, and other languages spoken fluently.     
The questionnaire was completed orally.

_Working memory test._ 
An aural version of @unsworth2005automated's Operation Span task (OSpan) was used to measure verbal working memory.
The aural version was selected because it aligns with the format of the linguistic task.
Participants heard a word and then heard a simple mathematical problem that could be either true (2 + 2 = 4) or false (2 + 2 = 5).
At the same time they heard the problem, participants saw the words TRUE or FALSE on each side of the screen.
They had to select the correct option through a key-press. 
The word-mathematical problem pairs were grouped in set.
At the end of each set, participants had to write down the words they had heard in the set in the same order they had appeared (see Figure 1 for a sample trial).
The task was coded and administered via PsychoPy.

There were two practice sets of two trials each, and three experimental sets of 3, 4, 5 and 6 word-mathematical problem pairs each, totaling 12 experimental sets.
The words and mathematical problems in each set appeared in a fixed order across participants.
The words TRUE and FALSE on the scree accompanying the oral mathematical problems appeared counterbalanced on each side across participants.
No feedback was provided.
The task was delivered inthe participant's L1.

### 4.3.2. Linguistic prediction task
A visual-world paradigm that recorded eye-movements was used to assess participants' abilities to predict verbal suffixes based onthe associated stressed or unstressed syllables. 
The eye-movements were recorded with an EyeLink 1000 Plus desktop mount eye-tracker from SR Research (sampling rate: 1k Hz; spatial resolution of .32^o^ horizontal and .25^o^ vertical; averaged calibration error: .01^o^).
The monitor was a BenQ XL2420TE display monitor at a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels. 
Tracking was binocular and the data were averaged across the right and left eyes.  _THAT IS NOT TRUE. TRACKING WAS MONOCULAR_
The task was programmed and delivered with SR Research’s Experiment Builder software, and the data were extracted with SR Research’s Data Viewer software. 
We followed Data Viewer’s cognitive parser settings (9-sample model) to isolate fixations (pauses over regions of interest). 
Smaller eye movements that take place during fixations (e.g., tremors, drifts, and micro saccades) were considered to form part of fixation if they did not surpass the aforementioned threshold, and were included because numerous studies show that they often mean little in higher-level analyses [e.g., @ditchburn1980function]. 
All equipment was identical for all participants. 

In the visual-world paradigm, participants read two verbs on a computer screen side by side (*salta* 's/he jumps,' *saltó* 's/he jumped') and heard a sentence containing one of the two verbs (*El ladrón saltó la valla* 'the thief jumped over the fence') and selected the verb they heard as possible with a key press (see Figure 2 for a sample trial). 
The verbs shown on the screen were conjugated in the present tense and preterit tense 3rd person singular forms of regular -ar verbs. 
There were 4 practice sentences, 16 experimental sentences, and 80 fillers. 
The sentences were 5 words long with a neutral structure NP~SUBJ~-V-NP~OBJ~. 
The subject and object noun phrases in each sentence for each condition within a pair were the same (*El ladrón salta/saltó la valla* 'the thief jumps/jumped over the fence').
The sentences were distributed into blocks by means of a Latin square design. 
That is, there were 8 blocks; each block contained 2 experimental sentences, one of each type, and 6 filler sentences. 
The blocks appeared in a randomized order. 
Within and across blocks, the sentences were pseudo-randomized to avoid two experimental sentences of the same condition appearing consecutively. 
The practice sentences were the same for all participants and appeared in a fixed order.
The sentences were played at an intensity of ~75dB.

Bisyllable Spanish regular verbs have 2 cues to tense: initial syllable stress and word ending morphology. 
Stressed initial syllables indicate that the tense is present (*salta* ‘s/he jumps’), and unstressed initial syllables indicate that the tense is past (preterit, *saltó* ‘s/he jumped’). 
Regarding morphology, the verb suffix indicates tense, person and aspect. 
In total there were 16 verbs, which renders 16 pairs of present and preterit forms.
The number of verbs in each tense on each side of the screen was counterbalanced across trials and across participants.

## 4.4. Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were conducted on R [@R-base] using the packages lme4 [@bates2014fitting] and multcomp [@hothorn2016package]. 
The gaze-fixation data was downsampled to 50 ms bins.
We analyzed the data at 200 ms after the time stamp of interest to account for the time it takes to plan and launch a saccade [e.g., @fischer1992saccadic; @saslow1967effects],  and centered at the onset of the last syllable of target items. 
The empirical logit transformation was applied to binary responses [fixations on target or distractor, @barr2008analyzing]. 
The bins were used to model a growth curve analysis [GCA, @mirman2016growth] to observe how the pattern of gaze fixations changed over time. 
Data were modeled using linear, quadratic, and cubic orthogonal polynomials.
We first ran a model for the monolingual speakers with lexical stress as fixed effect.
For the L2 speakers, we ran two models.
The first one included L1, lexical stress, and proficiency as fixed effects.
The second one included L1, lexical stress, and language use as fixed effects.
L1 was categorical and stood for transfer.
Lexical stress was categorical and had been sum-coded.
Proficiency and language use were continuous.
By-subject and by-item random effects were also tested. 
In all models, subject and item were tested for random effects.
Nested model comparisons were implemented to assess main effects and interactions.
