# 2. Background
## 2.1. L1 transfer
Cognitive models of L2 acquisition claim that a person's native language influences L2 acquisition [e.g., Competition Model, @li2012competition; @macwhinney1987competition].
This influence is called transfer or cross-linguistic influence [@lado1957linguistics].
L1 transfer effects vary depending on the L1, the L2 and the information being processed.
Sharing a structure (e.g., verbal morphology) in the L1 and the L2 accelerates the L2 acquisition process in comparison to differing structures across the L1 and the L2 [@luk2009acquisition; @melby2011cross].
L1 transfer has been found to affect processing of several L2 areas, including L2 syntax [see @lago2020role, for a review] and L2 morphosyntax [see @carrasco2017role, for a review].
Relevant to our study, L1 transfer also modulates L2 phonology and morphology.

Regarding L1 transfer effects on L2 phonology, speakers transfer L1 processing skills and L1 knowledge. 
Transfer of L1 processing skills allows L2 speakers to segment, analyze, manipulate, and assemble L2 speech sounds [@yang2017investigation] and has been shown to play a major role in L2 phonological awareness [see @saiegh2019phonological, for a review].
Apart from skills, L1 knowledge is crucial for L2 phonological processing at the segmental and suprasegmental level. 
At the segmental level, L1 Dutch speakers assimilate syllable- and word-final obstruents before voiced stops more often than before sonorant consonants in L2 English, following Dutch phonological rules instead of English rules [@simon2010phonological].
At the suprasegmental level, L1 French speakers have difficulties in perceiving lexical stress in L2 Spanish [@dupoux2008persistent].
In contrast, L1 Cantonese and Mandarin speakers can learn to discriminate lexical stress in an L2 [@chen2013chinese; @li2017effects] and L1 Korean speakers also do so although with some difficulty [@hualde2015acquisition; @lee2019perception].

The findings above suggest that depending on the overlap between the L1 and the L2 the effects of L1 transfer will be different.
Korean does not have lexical stress; there is no overlapping structure that therefore biases processing of L2 lexical stress.
Cantonese and Mandarin arguably have lexical stress, but it is mixed with lexical tone realization, making it hard to determine what information is carried by tone and which one by stress.
Lastly, French has lexical stress, like English or Spanish, but its nature is different.
In French, lexical stress is fixed and marks mostly phrasal boundaries.
The overlap in physical nature (i.e., the emphasis in a syllable) but the difference in function (i.e., word contrast) may be biasing French speakers in their processing of L2 lexical stress.

Concerning L1 transfer effects on L2 morphology, L1 transfer does not appear to impede L2 acquisition of inflectional morphology, but it makes its processing less efficient than in monolinguals [@hopp2010ultimate].
Acquisition of L2 morphology is more continuous when L2 learners can transfer knowledge of morphology between two morphologically rich languages than between a morphologically poor and a morphologically rich language [@clercq2019development].
L1 transfer of morphology is mediated by working memory, target language input and other languages known by the speaker, especially at the beginning of the L2 development, and by overlap between meaning of morphological structures.
Higher working memory individuals are better able to overcome L1 transfer biases [@sagarra2008working].
With respect to target language input, speakers use probability to make generalizations and rely not only in their L1 but also in other languages spoken to process the L2 [@rast2010role]. 
These L1 transfer effects are stronger when the L2 structure to be acquired is infrequent in the L2 [@larranaga2012l1].
The influence of other languages is also visible in L1 speakers of morphologically rich languages starting to rely on L2 morphology for L2 processing earlier than L1 speakers of morphologically poor languages [@sagarra2013seeing].
Lastly, forms with a greater semantic overlap are easier to acquire than those whose meaning overlaps less [@nishi2019verb].

Taken together, research on L2 phonology and morphology shows that L1 transfer is an important factor of L2 processing.
The characteristics of each language known by the speaker and how they overlap will determine the effects of L1 transfer and how difficult it is for the L2 speaker to overcome the effects.
In addition, L1 transfer interacts with other factors, such as working memory, in magnifying or reducing the L1 transfer effects.
Another such factor is L2 proficiency.
<!--The ability of speakers to create those associations is determined by the validity of the input, or cues, they receive [@macwhinney1997second].
The cue validity consists of three parts: frequency, availability, and reliability.
Frequency refers to how often an association is called upon.
Frequency is important in L2 acquisition because L2 is not and has not been used as frequently as the L1.
Availability refers to how typical an association is.
For example, in gender agreement in Spanish, the suffix *-o* is the most typical suffix for masculine adjectives and nouns, thus the more available.
However, there are other endings that can also indicate masculine, especially in nouns, such as *-e* or a consonant.
These endings are less typical and thus their availability is lower.
Finally, reliability refers to what cue is stronger when more than one cue is present.
For instance, the  most canonical form in Spanish is SVO, although other orders are possible, such as when clitic pronouns appear, in which case the order is SOV.
In Spanish it is also very frequent for subjects not to be explicit.
Thus, when an L2 speaker encounters a sentence like *lo vi ayer* (him saw~1 sg~ yesterday) 'I~NULL~ saw him yesterday' has two conflicting words: morphology vs word order and needs to learn that in Spanish morphology is a stronger cue.-->

## 2.2. L2 proficiency
L2 proficiency has constantly been shown to be a major factor in L2 processing.
Importantly, L2 proficiency modulates processing of L2 phonology and morphology.
In terms of L2 phonology, lower proficiency L2 learners can distinguish L2 phonemic contrasts when their attention is directed towards them; higher proficiency learners, in contrast, can also distinguish L2 phonemic contrasts in broader contexts and show similar brain activity to L1 speakers [@white2015phonological].
L2 proficiency also affects processing of sounds for word activation. Lower proficiency L2 learners activate phonologically similar translations of words in their L1, but this cross-linguistic activation diminishes as proficiency increases [@berghoff2021l1]
In terms of prosody, complete mastering of L2 prosody is difficult, even when highly proficient [@schmidt2020prosody].
The effects of L2 proficiency also cause L1 transfer effects in phonology to vary.
As the L2 system develops, the L1 transfer effects decrease [@jun2000acquisition].
Sometimes, however, the L1 transfer effects are only visible at advanced levels of proficiency, when there is an overlapping structure in both languages (e.g., lexical stress) that mixes up with another phonological structure only present in the L2 [e.g., lexical tones, @shih2010prosody].

With regard to L2 morphology, lower proficiency L2 learners show brain activity responses to L2 morphology (derived and inflected words, novel derivations and pseudo-suffixed words) that deviate from L1 processing-style, and these brain activity responses change as a function of proficiency to resemble L1 processing responses [@kimppa2019acquisition].
Behavioral studies with eye-tracking suggest that the processing similarity starts to be developed at intermediate stages of proficiency, when learners start to be sensitive to morphological processes and violations [@sagarra2013seeing].
The behavioral responses may however still be different between the native and non-native populations, as L1 speakers appear to be more conditioned by the internal structure of words than L2 speakers in activating them [@song2020second].

Like for phonology, L2 proficiency also conditions L1 transfer effects on L2 morphological processing.
Most research indicates that transfer at beginner stages is not strong [@rast2010role] or even null [@sagarra2008working].
Speakers at beginner stages of L2 acquisition may nevertheless show evidence of easier processing of L2 morphological structures when the L1 also has that structure [e.g., @ellis2008usage; @ellis2010bounds], and thus tend to rely on the morphological processing mechanisms of their L1 to process L2 morphology [@sagarra2013seeing].
Transfer starts to affect L2 processing more stably at intermediate levels [see @sagarra2020when, for a review] and continues to do so until the learner is very advanced or has reached a near-native level of proficiency [@hopp2010ultimate].

In summary, L2 proficiency modulates processing of phonological and morphological information. 
As proficiency increases, processing becomes more efficient.
However, an increased L2 proficiency alone does not guarantee monolingual-like processing, as it interacts with the L1 knowledge of the L2 speaker, resulting in effects that are still measurable even at advanced levels of proficiency.

## 2.5. Language use
L2 proficiency is important in L2 processing, but different patterns of language use may facilitate or hinder L2 processing in speakers at an otherwise similar proficiency
Bilingual speakers are likely to be more dominant in one language or another and to use a specific language in given contexts or with certain people, which will affect their language use patterns.
In turn, the variability in language use may cause differences in language processing.

Most research on language use has been conducted in the fields of code-switching and in cognitive control.
The findings in the code-switching field are relevant to the present study as they refer to language processing in particular, rather than general executive functions.
Research on language use and code-switching indicates that brain activity reflecting processing costs decrease with increased exposure to the phenomenon causing the cost. 
For instance, code-switching requires effortful processing for non-code-switchers, but its processing requires no extra in code-switchers effort compared to monolingual speech [@beatty2017bilingual], making code-switchers faster in adapting to code switches [@hartanto2016disparate].
This difference in language processing is observable even across individuals with similar proficiency, but who have different patterns of language activation [@beatty2020interactional].
The effect of language use is also evidenced in brain connectivity and proactive control in linguistic tasks [@gullifer2018bilingual].

Considering that L2 speakers vary in their L2 use, the findings on the relationship between code-switching and language use to L2 acquisition are easily extrapolated to L2 processing. 
For L2 speakers, an increased L2 use is likely to produce a less cognitively taxing L2 processing. 
It is even possible that the effects of language use in L2 speakers are more remarkable than in code-switchers, as their proficiencies in the L1 and the L2 are more likely to be more different than in code-switcher. 
The combination of language use and L2 proficiency will thus condition how the L2 is processed, and the L2 speakers create and use associations to predict what they are going to hear and alleviate the L2 processing.

<!--
Some authors have recently started to consider language use as key in the cognitive (advantage) development of bilingualism [e.g., Barbu, Orban, Gillet, & Poncelet, 2018; Bialystok, 2017; Blanco-Elorrieta & Pylkkänen, 2018; de Bruin, 2019].

## 2.4. L2 proficiency and L2 prediction
Linguistic prediction is a crucial aspect of language processing. Linguistic prediction consists of the anticipation of incoming linguistic information based on information already available.
The cue and outcome may belong to the same linguistic component [e.g., semantic cue-semantic outcome, @altmann1999incremental] or to different ones [e.g., phonological cue-morphological outcome, @sagarra2018suprasegmental].
Because of their probabilistic nature, associations are acquired gradually according to their frequency and consistency.
An association will be stronger the more examples in the input (high availability) and the more regular it is [high reliability, @bates1987competition].
These associations are crucial for language acquisition [@bates1982functionalist; @macwhinney1997second; @romberg2010statistical] and prediction [@kuperberg2016what]. 

Monolinguals use semantic-semantic [@altmann1999incremental], semantic-morphosyntactic [@altmann2007real], morphosyntactic [@gruter2016l2; @huettig2016prediction; @lew2010real], and morphophonological [@roll2010word; @roll2013word] predictive associations.
Relevantly for the study, morphophonological associations are typical across languages.
Among others, pitch accent can be used to predict noun and verb suffixes in Swedish [@roll2011activating; @schremm2017influence], lexical stress predicts verb noun suffixes in Spanish [@lozano2020slowly; @sagarra2018suprasegmental], and vowel duration predicts active and passive voice in English [@rehrig2017acoustic].

Unlike monolinguals, adult L2 learners show variability in making L2 predictions.
L2 prediction studies have primarily focused on morphosyntactic associations [e.g., @dussias2013gender; @gruter2013l2; @gruter2014role; @lew2010real].
The findings of these studies show that, while accurate, L2 learners are not able to make associations with native-like efficiency, and that such inability is due to L2 proficiency—the higher the proficiency, the likelier the prediction. 
Other factors such as variability in informativeness of the cue (e.g., gendered article), differences in L1 and L2 acquisition format (e.g., influence of top-down knowledge in L2 speakers), recency of cues, fewer opportunities to hear the associations, different processing strategies, cognitive maturity, or L1 transfer have been suggested as factors impeding monolingual-like efficiency but have not been properly researched. 
Of these factors, L1 transfer may prove to be crucial for acquisition of not only morphosyntactic, but also morphophonological associations.

## 2.5. L1 transfer and L2 phonological and morphological prediction
Research on the implicit acquisition of the within-word association between phonological cues and morphological outcomes has focused on pitch accent and lexical stress as cues, corresponding to Central and South Swedish and to Spanish.
In Central Swedish, Accent 1 cues present tense (*skrämme* 'I scare'), and Accent 2 cues past tense (*skrämde* 'I scared').
@schremm2016implicit explored L2 acquisition of pitch accent-suffix associations in verbs in Central Swedish.
L1 speakers of non-tonal languages learning L2 Central Swedish were faster at identifying words containing congruent accent-suffix associations than a L1 Swedish control group, but the difference in response time against incongruent words was larger in the L1 speakers. 
Since the participants in that study were intermediate to upper-intermediate, @gosselke2018neural tested whether L2 beginners could also learn and use pitch accent to predict morphological outcomes, noun number in this case, when their L1 does not have pitch accent.
The brain activity of the participants, L1 German-L2 Central Swedish speakers, revealed that they could not pre-activate noun number suffixes based on pitch accent yet.
These results suggest that L2 learners, similar to natives, were unconciously using pitch accents to predict grammatical suffixes already at intermediate levels of proficiency but not beginning stages. 
However, given that each study used different types of morphological outcomes, we cannot know if the inability to predict in the beginner groups is due to lacking the association or to the suffixes.

@gosselke2020different explored the effects of L1 transfer on the acquisition of morphophonological associations between pitch accent and suffixes.
They compared anticipation of number and gender suffixes in pseudo-nouns cued through pitch accent in a group of South Swedish speakers and in a group of German speakers as reflected by ERPs.
Participants' brain activity suggests that while Swedish speakers used knowledge of pitch accent in Swedish to process pitch accent in the pseudowords, the German speakers were not accessing pitch meaning to preactivate the suffixes.
Their accuracy at the end of the experiment was, however, similar.
The findings from this study demonstrate that the accent-suffix association was not established in low proficiency speakers yet, but intermediate speakers had already created it.
Furthermore, transferring acoustic processing abilities as well as the function associated to the acoustics from the L1 to the L2 can facilitate L2 acquisition of morphophonological associations. 

Regarding lexical stress-tense associations, @sagarra2018suprasegmental investigated the role of proficiency and verbal working memory in the integration of lexical stress in the stem of verbs as a cue to present and past tense suffixes in Spanish.
In Spanish, paroxytone stress in bisyllable verbs in Spanish cues present tense (*FIRma* 's/he signs'), while oxytone stress cues past tense (*firMÓ* 's/he signed').
They recruited Spanish monolinguals and English-Spanish late bilinguals whose proficiency was either beginner or advanced.
Eye-tracking data revealed that advanced L2 speakers of Spanish and monolinguals could predict tense based on lexically stressed and unstressed syllables, but beginner speakers could not.
In addition, the advanced L2 speakers only made predictions when the stem syllabic structure was CVC.
Working memory did not affect integration of lexical stress and prediction of verb tense suffixes, suggesting that working memory does not affect processing of morphophonological associations when the speaker has already had some experience with the language.

In the search for other factors constraining morphophonological prediction, @lozano2020slowly investigated whether anticipatory experience could affect anticipation abilities for the same type of association, for which they added a group of English-Spanish interpreters.
Anticipatory experience did have a positive effect in some conditions (CVC stem + past tense), allowing interpreters to predict faster, although not earlier, than monolinguals did.
The findings from the two studies on stress-suffix associations indicate that anticipation abilities for morphophonological associations are constrained by each speaker’s background.

In sum, the studies on lexical stress extend previous findings on pitch accent to other phonological structures.
By studying L2 populations at different levels of L2 development, these studies point towards the fundamental effects of L2 proficiency in L2 prediction.
However, by leaving L1 transfer out, it is impossible to ascertain so far how morphophonological prediction abilities are conditioned by the previous linguistic knowledge of the speakers.

## 2.6. Linguistic phenomena
Morphophonological associations are crucial for the efficient processing of morphology.
This study focuses on a morphophonological association of lexical stress as the cue and verb tense suffix as the outcome.
In order to study different possible degrees of transfer of association, English and Mandarin Chinese were selected as the L1s and Spanish as the L2.

### 2.4.1. Lexical stress (the cue)
Lexical stress is the emphasis of a syllable relative to the rest of the syllables in a word [@hualde2005sounds]. 
Spanish and English have lexical stress, and Mandarin Chinese arguably so.
Different acoustic correlates, their importance or weight, and how they combine cause the acoustic realization of lexical stress in each language to vary. 
In Spanish, pitch (F0) is higher for stressed syllables and lower for unstressed syllables, and stressed syllables sound louder and are usually slightly longer [@hualde2005sounds; @ortega2006phonetic; @ortega2007disentangling; @ortega2009perception].
In English, the main correlates are vowel duration and quality [@cooper2002constraints; @cutler1986forbear], but other correlates such as pitch are also involved in stressed syllables [@fry1955duration; @fry1958experiments].
Lexical stress in Mandarin Chinese is harder to classify.
Some scholars have in fact described Mandarin Chinese as a language without stress [@hyman1977nature], while others propose that Mandarin Chinese may have some realization of lexical stress [e.g., @duanmu2007phonology].
However, it is unclear how stress is represented in speakers' minds. 
Shanghai Chinese speakers, for example, may have no judgment on stress [@selkirk1990prosodic].
Research on the phonetic realization of Mandarin Chinese lexical stress has revealed that it may rely duration, vowel quality, and pitch height [@lin1980acoustic].

In English and Spanish, lexical stress has no fixed position, playing a phonologically contrastive function at the lexical level depending on its location. 
This contrastive function is more typical in Spanish than in English. 
In English, lexical stress is used predominantly to distinguish heteronyms or pairs of verb-noun that have no segmental differences (to “proDUCE,” verb vs “PROduce,” noun). 
In Spanish, lexical stress differentiates all kinds of word categories and information, such as verbal tense and person (*CANto* “I sing” vs *canTÓ* “s/he sang”), or nouns (*PApa* “potato” vs *paPÁ* “dad”), or nouns from verbs (*TÉRmino* “term” vs. *terMIno* “I finish” vs *termiNÓ* “s/he finished”).  

<!--Lexical stress facilitates lexical activation in L1 Spanish [@soto2001segmental], such that a prosodically matching cue to the target (*prinCI* > *prinCIpio*, “start”) results in shorter and more accurate activation times, when compared to mismatching cues (*PRINci* > *prinCIpio* 'start'). 
These results suggest that speakers use lexical stress to activate a lexical item, which may result in anticipation of a word ending based on it [@lozano2020slowly; @sagarra2018suprasegmental].
L1 English speakers, in contrast, did not use placement of lexical stress to activate a word in comparison to competitors with different stress patterns, only when more than one syllable of the word has already been heard [@cooper2002constraints].
These results indicate that L1 English speakers do not rely on lexical stress as much as L1 Spanish speakers do for word activation. However, even L1 English speakers use lexical stress for word prediction [@perdomo2019prosodic].-->

In Mandarin, pitch in lexical stress interacts with lexical tones. 
Tones are the pitch contour modulations in each syllable [@chao1968grammar].
Many languages use tones, or changes in pitch-contour, at a phrasal level for pragmatic purposes. 
However, only a few use tones contrastively at a lexical level. 
The acoustic correlate for tones in most Mandarin dialects (e.g., from Beijing and Tianjin) is pitch contour [@gandour1978perception; @zhu2015tone], accompanied by other correlates like creakiness for some of the tones [e.g., tone 3; @chao1968grammar<!--; @davidson1991acoustic-->]. 
The interaction of pitch in stress with pitch in tones may prevent speakers from distinguishing between stress or tones.
<!--Mandarin tones facilitate word recognition [@malins2010roles], although segmental cues are the primary activator, especially vowels [@hu2012dissociation; @sereno2015contribution; @wiener2016constraints]. 
The role of tones in Mandarin for activation and word ending anticipation therefore does not completely overlap with the role of lexical stress in Spanish. 
Mandarin speakers need to pay attention to the pitch variations in order to assign the correct tone to the word they are hearing.-->

### 2.4.2. Verbal inflectional morphology (the outcome)
The outcome in the morphophonological association with lexical stress tested in this study is verbal tense suffix.
Spanish is a morphologically rich language, using suffixes to indicate tense along with other information such as aspect, person and number (*lavó* 's/he wash-ed~3 SG Past Perfect~').
All tenses and all persons require their own suffix, usually different from each other, and each verb needs to be conjugated even if the time frame and person have already been established.

English is a morphologically poorer language than Spanish.
English indicates some information with bound morphemes, such as past tense (-ed) or 3rd person singular in the present tense (-s).
English indicates some tenses with independent morphemes, like future (will) or conditional (would), but these morphemes do not vary according to person or number.

Finally, Mandarin Chinese does not use inflectional morphology to indicate tense.
The same word is used for all tenses (e.g., 吃 /chī/ 'eat') and tense is indicated lexically, via temporal adverbs (e.g., "yesterday") or unbound particles (e.g.,了 /le/ indicates completeness or near future).
These particles do not change depending on the person the verb refers to and, similarly to temporal adverbs, can oftentimes be omitted once the time frame has been established.
