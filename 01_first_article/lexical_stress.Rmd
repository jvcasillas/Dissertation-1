Lexical stress is the auditory emphasis of a syllable relative to the rest of the syllables in a word (Hualde, 2005).
Spanish and English have lexical stress, and Mandarin Chinese arguably so. Different acoustic correlates, their importance or weight, and their combinations cause the acoustic realization of lexical stress in each language to vary. 
In Spanish, pitch (F0) is higher for stressed syllables and lower for unstressed syllables, and stressed syllables sound louder and are usually slightly longer (Hualde, 2005; Ortega-Llebaria, 2006; Ortega-Llebaria & Prieto, 2007, 2009).
Lexical stress plays a phonologically contrastive function at the lexical level depending on its location.
It may differentiate verbal tense and person (CANto “I sing” vs canTÓ “s/he sang”), nouns (PApa “potato” vs paPÁ “dad”), or nouns from verbs (TÉRmino “term” vs. terMIno “I finish” vs termiNÓ “s/he finished”), for instance. 
Lexical stress thus facilitates lexical activation in Spanish (Soto-Faraco et al., 2001).

In English, the main correlates are vowel duration and quality (Cooper, Cutler, & Wales, 2002; Cutler, 1986), but other correlates such as pitch may also be involved in stressed syllables (Fry, 1955, 1958). 
Like in Spanish, lexical stress is used predominantly to distinguish heteronyms or pairs of verb-noun that have no segmental differences (to “proDUCE,” verb vs “PROduce,” noun). 
However, English speakers only use it in certain cases and rely more on segmental information for lexical activation (Cooper et al., 2002).

Lexical stress in Mandarin Chinese is harder to classify. 
Some scholars have in fact described Mandarin Chinese as a language without stress (Hyman, 1977), while others propose that Mandarin Chinese may have some realization of lexical stress (e.g., Duanmu, 2007). 
However, it is unclear how stress is represented in speakers’ minds. 
Shanghai Chinese speakers, for example, have no judgment on stress (Selkirk & Shen, 1990). 
Research on the phonetic realization of Mandarin Chinese lexical stress has revealed that it may rely on duration, vowel quality, and pitch height (Lin & Yan, 1980). 
In Mandarin, pitch in lexical stress interacts with lexical tones. 
All dialects and variants of Chinese, regardless of whether they are Northern, Min, Hakka or any other, have lexical tones; they only differ in the tone inventory (see Zhang, 2014; for a review). 
Tones are the pitch contour modulations in each syllable (Chao, 1968). 
The acoustic correlate for tones in most Mandarin dialects (e.g., from Beijing and Tianjin) is pitch contour (Gandour & Fromkin, 1978; Zhu & Wang, 2015), accompanied by other correlates like creakiness for some of the tones (e.g., tone 3, Chao, 1968). 
The interaction of pitch in stress with pitch in tones may prevent speakers from distinguishing between stress or tones.
For Mandarin speakers, segmental information in the shape of vowels and to a lesser extent consonants is more important than suprasegmental information (i.e., tones) in activating words (Hu et al., 2012; Wiener & Turnbull, 2016).
In this context, lexical stress is not related to word structure but to pragmatic intentions (Zhang & Li, 2011).

Spanish, English and Mandarin differ in how they realize stress and in how it is used during processing. 
English shares with Spanish the contrastive function and the absence of any competing suprasegmental structure. 
Mandarin Chinese lexical stress barely shares acoustic correlates with Spanish, is mixed with tones and does not contrast words. 
We can therefore conclude that Spanish and English lexical stress is phonologically closer, while Spanish and Mandarin lexical stress is phonologically more distant.
