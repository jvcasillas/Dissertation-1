# L2 use effects


l1ma (γ01)									−0.190	.047		Mand predicted less
Time1 × l1ma (γ31)							−1.072	< .001		decreased slope
Time2 × Lexical stress (γ12)				0.274	.032		change from parox to ox, increased the bowing
Time1 × use_z (γ22)							0.533	.014		more use, more prediction
Time1 × l1ma:Lexical stress × use_z (γ30)	0.245	.031		increased slope for man in one stress condition as a function of use
Time2 × l1ma:Lexical stress × use_z (γ11)	−0.323	.004		decreased bowing for mand in one stress condition as a function of use
Time3 × l1ma:Lexical stress × use_z (γ31)	−0.426	< .001		sharper vertices for mand in one stress condition as a function of use



# Efectos claros
- Proficiency increases prediction: more and faster (for both groups)
- Stress: oxytones predicted later, but faster
- Use increases prediction
- Mandarin speakers predict less, and slower??
