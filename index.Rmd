# Pitch

Musical abilities influence positively the production and perception of linguistic sound structures in in children <font size="-1">(Magne et al., 2006)</font>, adults <font size="-1">(Wong et al., 2007)</font> and L2 learners <font size="-1">(Slevc & Miyake, 2006)</font>.

Tonal memory is significantly correlated to the gained skill to discriminate L2 vowels <font size="-1">(Ghaffarvand Mokari & Werner, 2018)</font>.

musical knowledge of pitch facilititates perception of L2 tones in musician speakers of non-tonal L1s <font size="-1">(Ngo et al., 2016)</font>. On the other hand, non-musician speakers of L1 tonal languages have increased ability in pitch and music perception in general <font size="-1">(Bidelman et al., 2013)</font>. 
This relationship shows between perception of pitch in L1 tonal languages and absolute pitch in music <font size="-1">(e.g., Chua & Brunt, 2014; Deutsch et al., 2009; Ngo et al., 2016)</font>.

The relationship does not show in other areas, like relative pitch and L1 tone knowledge <font size="-1">(Ngo et al., 2016)</font>.

@chan2019lexical studied the creation of L2 tone-segment connections in musicians and non-musicians

Pitch is the frequency associated to a sound wave; this frequency places the sound within a scale ranging from low to high in perception

Rhythm

Predictive in nature (When the interval between beats is on or under 1500 ms, the synchronization behavior tends towards anticipation of the next beat, while this anticipation rate starts to decrease with beat onset intervals of 1800 ms <font size="-1">(Miyake et al., 2004)</font>)

Multimodal (synchronization driven by a silent moving visual stimulus can be as accurate as that driven by sound, and that deaf individuals could synchronize their movements as well or even better than hearing individuals when presented with visual stimuli.)

Rhythmic production scores were a reliable predictor of L2 stress placement. <font size="-1">(Cason et al., 2019)</font>. @bhatara2015foreign tested stress placement and rhythmic abilities in L1 French speakers and L2 Spanish. The rhythmic production scores of the participants predicted correct placement of nuclear stress in a L2 lexical stress imitation task; and rhythm perception was actually positively associated with L2 learning experience.

rhythm perception was not associated with reading abilities in both the L1 and L2 <font size="-1">(Swaminathan et al., 2018)</font>

???

Rhythm is defined as a pattern of recurrent time intervals that usually occur periodically. This periodic nature allows to predict the start of an interval or the next recurring event based on what has already been perceived

Egocentric vs geocentric linguistic representation of space

ilinguals of two languages with an alphabetic system like English and a logosyllabic system like Chinese have enhanced visuospatial WM than bilinguals of two alphabetic systems, like English and Spanish <font size="-1">(Ma, 2016)</font>. Observing bilinguals in general, both visual and auditory memory maintenance and manipulation capcities, and bilingual experience interact especially at an L2 intermediate level, while at advanced levels the interaction goes back to a more monolingual-like state <font size="-1">(Yang, 2017)</font>.

# Research Questions

## Study 1  
	
**RQ1. Do Spanish monolinguals, and intermediate and advanced Mandarin and English learners of Spanish use lexical stress to anticipate verbal suffixes in Spanish?** 
**If so, are prediction abilities mediated by verbal WM?**

**H1.** Only monolingual and advanced L2 speakers will anticipate <font size="-1">(Lozano et al., 2019; Sagarra & Casillas, 2018)</font>, but L2 will not reach native-like performance <font size="-1">(Perdomo & Kaan, 2019)</font>.
WM will only affect performance in the L2 groups <font size="-1">(Huettig & Mani, 2016; Otten & van Berkum, 2009; Sagarra & Casillas, 2018)</font>.

# Research Questions

## Study 2   
	
**RQ2. Is linguistic prediction of word morphology associated with auditory prediction in Spanish monolinguals, and intermediate and advanced Chinese and English learners of Spanish?** 
**If so, how do WM, L1 transfer and L2 proficiency mediate this relationship?**

**H2.** _Pitch_
No association between pitch and speech abilities in L1 speakers. WM is only expected to have an effect on non-linguistic auditory prediction abilities <font size="-1">(Roden et al., 2014)</font>.
Mandarin L1 speakers are expected to anticipate melodic information faster than any of the other populations. Their performance in anticipating melodic information will not be correlated with their L2 anticipation performance. No association between pitch and speech prediction abilities in the English learners. All auditory anticipation scores will be positively correlated with verbal WM scores in the L2 speakers <font size="-1">(Yang, 2017)</font>.

_Rhythm_
Better rhythm anticipation abilities are expected to be associatd with individual variability of speech anticipation in all participants <font size="-1">(Cason & Schön, 2012)</font>. For L2 speakers, this rhythmic influence on speech anticipation will be visible at all levels of proficiency and regardless of the L1.
WM is only expected to have an effect on non-linguistic auditory prediction abilities for all speakers <font size="-1">(Colley et al., 2018)</font>.

# Research Questions

## Study 3   
	
**RQ3. Is linguistic prediction of word morphology associated with visuospatial prediction in Spanish monolinguals, and intermediate and advanced Chinese and English learners of Spanish?** 
**If so, how do WM, L1 transfer and L2 proficiency mediate this relationship?**

**H3.** Language prediction abilities in the L1 and the L2 are not expected to be associated with the visuospatial domain. Verbal WM will not be associated with speech anticipation performance, but it might be associated with visuospatial WM due to cross-domain influence <font size="-1">(Colley et al., 2018)</font>.
Visuospatial WM performance will in return be associated with visuospatial anticipation <font size="-1">(Pan et al., 2014; Woodman & Luck, 2004)</font>.

# Conclusion

**Goal:** to examine the role of language experience (L1 transfer, L2 proficiency) (Study 1), non-linguistic auditory prediction (Study 2), and visuospatial prediction (Study 3), on L1 and L2 linguistic prediction of word endings based on prosodic cues, and the mediation of verbal and visuospatial WM morphosyntactic anticipation based on lexical stress in the L1 and the L2.

**Relevance:** Results would confirm whether different cognitive domains in the auditory modality can influence speech anticipation, and thus if anticipation relies at least partially on domain-general cognitive mechanisms that may be shared within and across modalities, and, therefore, whether better anticipatory abilities in other modalities do not affect linguistic prediction.
