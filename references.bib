@article{graaf2013alpha,
	Abstract = {Oscillations are an important aspect of neuronal activity. Interestingly, oscillatory patterns are also observed in behaviour, such as in visual performance measures after the presentation of a brief sensory event in the visual or another modality. These oscillations in visual performance cycle at the typical frequencies of brain rhythms, suggesting that perception may be closely linked to brain oscillations. We here investigated this link for a prominent rhythm of the visual system (the alpha-rhythm, 8-12 Hz) by applying rhythmic visual stimulation at alpha-frequency (10.6 Hz), known to lead to a resonance response in visual areas, and testing its effects on subsequent visual target discrimination. Our data show that rhythmic visual stimulation at 10.6 Hz: 1) has specific behavioral consequences, relative to stimulation at control frequencies (3.9 Hz, 7.1 Hz, 14.2 Hz), and 2) leads to alpha-band oscillations in visual performance measures, that 3) correlate in precise frequency across individuals with resting alpha-rhythms recorded over parieto-occipital areas. The most parsimonious explanation for these three findings is entrainment (phase-locking) of ongoing perceptually relevant alpha-band brain oscillations by rhythmic sensory events. These findings are in line with occipital alpha-oscillations underlying periodicity in visual performance, and suggest that rhythmic stimulation at frequencies of intrinsic brain-rhythms can be used to reveal influences of these rhythms on task performance to study their functional roles.},

	Abstract = {A usage-based view takes grammar to be the cognitive organization of one's experience with language. Aspects of that experience, for instance, the frequency of use of certain constructions or particular instances of constructions, have an impact on representation that is evidenced in speaker knowledge of conventionalized phrases and in language variation and change. It is shown that particular instances of constructions can acquire their own pragmatic, semantic, and phonological characteristics. In addition, it is argued that high-frequency instances of constructions undergo grammaticization processes (which produce further change), function as the central members of categories formed by constructions, and retain their old forms longer than lower-frequency instances under the pressure of newer formations. An exemplar model that accommodates both phonological and semantic representation is elaborated to describe the data considered.},

	Abstract = {Publisher Summary This chapter presents a body of new experimental evidence, which provides a firm basis for the working memory hypothesis. The chapter presents a series of experiments on the role of memory in reasoning, language comprehension, and learning. An attempt is made to apply the comparable techniques in all three cases to allow a common pattern to emerge, if the same working memory system is operative in all three instances. The chapter makes a case for postulating the working memory-LTS system as a modification of the current STS-LTS view. Working memory represents a control system with limits on both its storage and processing capabilities, and has access to phonemically coded information (possibly by controlling a rehearsal buffer), that it is responsible for the limited memory span, but does not underlie the recency effect in free recall. The experiments presented in the chapter suggest that the phonemic rehearsal buffer plays a limited role in this process, but is by no means essential. These experiments also suggest that working memory plays a part in verbal reasoning and in prose comprehension. Understanding the detailed role of working memory in these tasks, however, must proceed hand-in-hand with an understanding of the tasks themselves. "},

@article{roll2015neurolinguistic,
	Abstract = {The brain response to words with correct and incorrect word accent--suffix combinations in South Swedish was investigated using electroencephalography (EEG). Accent 1 yielded an increased brain response (`preactivation negativity') that has previously been interpreted as reflecting preactivation of suffixes. Preactivation is greater for accent 1 due to its association with a limited set of suffixes, whereas accent 2 is default for compound words. The tonal realization of the word accent opposition in South Swedish is practically the mirror image of that in Central Swedish, where a similar preactivation negativity has been found. Therefore, the brain response is unlikely to result from a difference in acoustic features between the word accents. Invalidly cued suffixes yielded brain response pattern showing increased processing load of the unexpected suffix (negative electric potential) followed by its reprocessing (positivity `P600').},

	Abstract = {<p>An eye-tracking experiment examined whether prosodic cues can affect the interpretation of grammatical functions in the absence of clear morphological information. German listeners were presented with scenes depicting three potential referents while hearing temporarily ambiguous SVO and OVS sentences. While case marking on the first noun phrase (NP) was ambiguous, clear case marking on the second NP disambiguated sentences towards SVO or OVS. Listeners interpreted case-ambiguous NP1s more often as Subject, and thus expected an Object as upcoming argument, only when sentence beginnings carried an SVO-type intonation. This was revealed by more anticipatory eye movements to suitable Patients (Objects) than Agents (Subjects) in the visual scenes. No such preference was found when sentence beginnings had an OVS-type intonation. Prosodic cues were integrated rapidly enough to affect listeners' interpretation of grammatical function before disambiguating case information was available....},

	Abstract = {<p>The phonological memory skills of a group of children with disordered language development were compared with those of two control groups, one group matched on verbal abilities and the other matched on nonverbal intelligence. The language-disordered children were poorer at repeating single nonwords and recalling word lists than even the younger children of matched verbal abilities. The language-disordered children were, however, sensitive to both the phonological similarity and word length of the memory lists, except for the longest lists. The results of two further experiments indicate that the poor memory performance of the language-disordered children is unlikely to be due to either impaired perceptual processing or to slow articulation rates. Our proposal is that a deficit of phonological storage in working memory may underpin the poor memory performance of the language-disordered children, and could play a central role in their disordered language development.</p>},
